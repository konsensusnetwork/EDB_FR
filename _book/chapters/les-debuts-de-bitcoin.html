<p>[Lettrine L][Smallcaps e] On October 31, 2008, an individual calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto shared a brief document online that described the technical workings of an innovative digital currency system: Bitcoin. This nine-page white paper, presented as a scientific article, was titled <em>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</em>. In it, Satoshi proposed a solution to the problem of online payments by implementing a distributed timestamp server based on a proof-of-work algorithm.</p>
<p>But it went much further. The Bitcoin white paper laid the groundwork for a profound conceptual revolution: a purely digital currency that relied on no trusted third party, neither for transaction confirmation nor for the issuance of new units. What Satoshi had just discovered was much more than a payment system; it was a new type of money, something no one had been able to conceive until then—an economic and social phenomenon that would achieve unprecedented success in the years to follow.</p>
<p>In particular, Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation realized the long-held dream of a digital currency escaping state control—a dream cherished by the cypherpunks. Dating back to the early 1990s, this movement advocated the proactive use of cryptography to ensure individual privacy and freedom on the internet. These rebellious cryptographers had long desired and attempted to design such electronic cash, as it was a fundamental part of their ideal. Unfortunately, these efforts had not succeeded, at least until the emergence of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>From that pivotal date, Bitcoin was implemented and experienced a series of foundational events that led it to where it is today. These events shaped our understanding of it, and the story of Bitcoin’s early days is therefore a unique narrative worth recounting.</p>
<section id="une-naissance-difficile" class="level2 unnumbered page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="une-naissance-difficile">A Difficult Birth</h2>
<p>Bitcoin was conceived by an individual using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who claimed to be a 33-year-old Japanese man<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Little is known about him beyond his public messages and the computer code he published. Satoshi disappeared in 2011, and it is unknown whether he is still alive.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Some believe Satoshi Nakamoto was a pseudonym used by a group. However, we’ll assume here that a single person was behind the messages and code attributed to Bitcoin’s creator, without denying possible assistance.</p></div><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Satoshi Nakamoto, <em>Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper</em>, 11/09/2008 01:58:48 UTC: <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014832.html" class="uri">https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014832.html</a>.</p></div></div><p>According to his own account, Satoshi Nakamoto began working on Bitcoin in the spring of 2007. For more than a year, he kept his model secret, wanting to ensure it worked correctly before presenting it to the world. He would later claim to have coded the prototype before writing the paper<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In August 2008, Satoshi finished drafting the white paper and began preparing to announce Bitcoin’s release. On August 18, he registered the domain name Bitcoin.org via the anonymous service AnonymousSpeech<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. The domain would be used to host Bitcoin’s main website.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Satoshi also registered the domain Netcoin.org around the same time, suggesting he hadn’t finalized his choice of name.—Or Weinberger on Twitter, 09/23/2022 08:54 UTC: <a href="https://twitter.com/orweinberger/status/1573234325046558720" class="uri">https://twitter.com/orweinberger/status/1573234325046558720</a>.</p></div><div id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Gwern Branwen, <em>Wei Dai/Satoshi Nakamoto 2009 Bitcoin emails</em>, March 17, 2014: <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/bitcoin/2008-nakamoto" class="uri">https://gwern.net/doc/bitcoin/2008-nakamoto</a>.</p></div></div><p>A few days later, he contacted Adam Back, the British cryptographer and cypherpunk behind Hashcash, the technique used in Bitcoin to compute the proof of work. Adam Back referred him to the cryptographer Wei Dai, the inventor of the b-money concept in 1998—a concept with notable similarities to Bitcoin. On August 22, Satoshi emailed Wei Dai to tell him he was “getting ready to release a paper that expands on [his] ideas into a fully working system” and to ask him “the publication year of [his] b-money page” to reference it in the white paper<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. However, despite these interactions, Adam Back and Wei Dai did not immediately take interest in Bitcoin. It would be years later before they revisited this revolutionary discovery by the mysterious figure.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2008, Satoshi decided to make his system public. On October 5, he registered on the project management platform SourceForge, where Bitcoin’s open-source code would be hosted and maintained until 2011. On October 31, he published the white paper on a cryptography mailing list. This list, the Metzdowd Cryptography Mailing List managed by Perry Metzger on his website Metzdowd.com, included participation from several former cypherpunks<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. In his introductory email, he wrote:</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Archives of the Metzdowd mailing list are publicly available at <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/" class="uri">https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/</a>. Cypherpunks present in 2008 included John Gilmore, Hal Finney, James A. Donald, Robert Hettinga, Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, and Len Sassaman.</p></div><div id="fn6"><p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Satoshi Nakamoto, <em>Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper</em>, 10/31/2008 18:10:00 UTC: <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html" class="uri">https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html</a>.</p></div></div><p>“I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.”</p>
<p>The white paper centered on the problem of online payments, and the goal of Bitcoin was clearly stated from the outset:</p>
<p>“Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model. […] What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn7"><p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Satoshi Nakamoto, <em>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</em>, October 31, 2008.</p></div></div><p>From a technical standpoint, it involved establishing a distributed ledger of transactions over an open peer-to-peer network of computers. This ledger was composed of blocks of transactions linked sequentially over time, forming a “chain of blocks.” Bitcoin thus constituted a “distributed timestamp server,” recording the order of transactions to create a coherent history without “double spending.” This allowed for the management of the issuance and exchange of a digital unit of account, which would be called bitcoin.</p>
<p>The system’s reliability rested on “proofs of work” that linked the blocks together, making it difficult to alter the chain. These proofs were periodically produced by network members who provided energy for this purpose and were rewarded with an “incentive” in bitcoins, consisting of newly created units and transaction fees. Those who expended their electrical energy were compared by Satoshi to “gold miners who expend resources to add gold to circulation,” hence the term miners that they would later adopt.</p>
<p>Following Bitcoin’s announcement and the publication of the white paper, Satoshi received few responses, many of them skeptical. First, cypherpunk James A. Donald questioned the system’s scalability, saying that “it does not seem to scale to the required size<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.” Then, John Levine criticized its security, mentioning the computing power held by “farms of zombie machines<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>,” composed of computers controlled by hackers. Finally, a third individual named Ray Dillinger questioned the value of the unit of account, lamenting that “computational proofs of work have no intrinsic value<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn8"><p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;“We very, very much need such a system, but as I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size.”—James A.

Notably, Hal Finney, an American computer scientist and cryptographer in his fifties, was decidedly enthusiastic. In his message on November 7, he wrote that “Bitcoin seems to be a very promising idea<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.” Hal Finney was no ordinary person: a founding member of the cypherpunk movement, he had participated in developing the encryption software PGP in the 1990s alongside Philip Zimmermann, experimented with early electronic money systems, and even attempted to create his own system of reusable proofs of work. Despite his experience, he remained optimistic and thus became the very first supporter of Satoshi’s project. Years later, he would state that “aged cryptographers […] tend to become cynical,” but he “was more idealistic,” having “always loved cryptography, its mystery and paradox<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>.”</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="une-enfance-timide">A Timid Childhood</h2>
<p>Two months after the publication of the white paper, on January 8, 2009, at 7:27 PM, Satoshi Nakamoto shared the first version of the software on the Metzdowd mailing list. The source code in C++ was openly published under a free license (MIT), allowing anyone to copy, modify, and use the software at will. It contained the data of the genesis block, the first block of the chain from which it would extend.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Satoshi began mining. The second block of the chain, block 1, was validated by Satoshi on January 9 at 2:54 AM, marking the official launch of the network.</p>
<p>On January 10, Hal tried to run the software. After communicating with Satoshi to get it working, he began mining and found his first block (block 78) at 1 AM (UTC), earning 50 bitcoins. Two and a half hours later, he shared his experience on Twitter (a nascent social media platform) by writing “<em>Running bitcoin</em><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.” The next day, during the night of January 11–12, Satoshi sent 10 bitcoins to Hal via his IP address—the first transfer from one person to another on the network<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn14"><p><sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Hal Finney on Twitter, 01/11/2009 3:33 UTC: <a href="https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988" class="uri">https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988</a>.</p></div><div id="fn15"><p><sup>15</sup>&nbsp;This first transaction between Satoshi and Hal had the identifier f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16 and was confirmed in block 170 on January 12 at 3:30.</p></div><div id="fn16"><p><sup>16</sup>&nbsp;The identifier of the transaction received by Dustin (via P2IP) was d71fd2f64c0b34465b7518d240c00e83f6a5b10138a7079d1252858fe7e6b577.</p></div></div><p>Hal was not the only person experimenting on the network at that time. Dustin Trammell, an American computer security researcher who had discovered Bitcoin through the mailing list, was also involved. He communicated with Satoshi via email and received 25 bitcoins from him on January 15<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>.</p>
<p>But the few people running the software were not enough. From the outset, Satoshi knew that few had seriously examined his model and that attracting new users and contributors would be challenging. He therefore tried to generate enthusiasm by promoting his idea as effectively as possible.</p>
<p>The first element was the bitcoin issuance schedule, capped at 21 million units. In the email announcing the prototype, Satoshi outlined the monetary creation rate:</p>
<p>“The total number of coins in circulation will be 21,000,000. They will be distributed to network nodes when they create blocks, with the amount released halving every 4 years. […] Once that sum is exhausted, the system can support transaction fees if needed<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn17"><p><sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Satoshi Nakamoto, <em>Bitcoin v0.1 released</em>, 01/08/2009 19:27:40 UTC: <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.html" class="uri">https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.html</a>.</p></div><div id="fn18"><p><sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Hal Finney, <em>Re: Bitcoin v0.1 released</em>, 01/11/2009 02:22:01 UTC: <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html" class="uri">https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html</a>.</p></div></div><p>Bitcoin was thus intended to become a currency with a fixed supply, inherently deflationary—a characteristic that generated excitement. On January 11, Hal Finney was the first to respond, expressing delight that “the system can be configured to allow only a certain maximum number of coins to be generated.” He estimated that if “Bitcoin [is] successful and [becomes] the dominant payment system used worldwide,” each coin would then be “worth about ten million dollars<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>.” While the estimate is debatable, the reasoning remains pertinent given how Bitcoin functions.</p>
<p>On January 16, Satoshi reiterated this message in an email shared with the mailing list, stating that it “might make sense to get some [coins] just in case it catches on” and that “if enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>.” This point is crucial, as evidenced by Dustin Trammell’s testimony, who told Satoshi that Hal’s reasoning was “one of the reasons why [he] spun up a node so quickly.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn19"><p><sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Satoshi Nakamoto, <em>Bitcoin v0.1 released</em>, 01/16/2009 16:03:14 UTC: <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015014.html" class="uri">https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015014.html</a>.</p></div></div><p>Beyond the issuance schedule, Satoshi chose to highlight flaws in the banking system—a second strategy to attract attention.</p>
<p>He did this from the very first block, the genesis block, by including the headline from the British daily <em>The Times</em> of January 3, 2009, announcing that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was on the brink of a second bailout for banks:</p>
<p><em>“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”</em></p>
<p>This phrase in the first block serves a dual purpose: it prevents backdating by proving that the system wasn’t launched before January 3 (since Satoshi couldn’t have known the headline before that date), and it symbolically indicates what Bitcoin opposes by referencing the monetary and financial context of the time.</p>
<p>In January 2009, the world was reeling from the effects of the financial crisis that began in 2007 with the bursting of the housing bubble in the United States, known as the subprime mortgage crisis. Governments were bailing out banks to prevent further failures after the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, and central banks were engaging in quantitative easing by injecting liquidity into financial markets. This use of public funds, essentially created for the occasion, deeply shocked many citizens who realized that the banking system was, in effect, one of private profits and socialized losses.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of trusted third parties, Bitcoin wasn’t subject to the whims of a central bank. It contrasted with state currencies like the dollar or the euro, whose supply could be arbitrarily modified by those controlling monetary creation through what’s known as monetary policy. Bitcoin’s monetary policy was programmed—hard-coded into the protocol—to theoretically never be altered.</p>
<p>Satoshi highlighted this when he posted on the forum of the P2P Foundation, an organization studying the impact of peer-to-peer infrastructures on society, on February 11, 2009. In his introductory message about Bitcoin, he wrote:</p>
<p>“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn20"><p><sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Satoshi Nakamoto, <em>Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency</em>, February 11, 2009: <a href="https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source" class="uri">https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source</a>.</p></div></div><p>On his profile, where he indicated being a 33-year-old man living in Japan, he provided a particular date of birth: April 5, 1975. This date, likely fictitious and composite, probably refers to the prohibition on individual ownership of gold in the United States. April 5 corresponds to the day Executive Order 6102 was signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt on April 5, 1933, instituting the ban, and the year 1975 marks its repeal with the enactment of Public Law 93-373. This detail isn’t trivial, as the prohibition ultimately led to the establishment of a floating monetary regime with no link to gold.</p>
<p>This isn’t the only reference to precious metals. On February 18, Satoshi wrote in his comments:</p>
<p>“There is […] no one to act as a central bank or Federal Reserve to adjust the money supply as the number of users grows. […] In that sense, it’s more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply varying to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. This might create a positive feedback loop: more users drive higher value, which could attract more users seeking to benefit from the increasing value<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>.”</p>

Even though some people eventually turned away from Bitcoin, like Hal Finney, Satoshi continued to receive messages from interested individuals. On April 11, 2009, Mike Hearn, a British developer working for Google and dabbling in open-source software in his spare time, emailed him with a series of questions about Bitcoin, noting that “it’s rare to encounter truly revolutionary ideas<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>.” Hearn was interested in digital currencies at the time, including Ripple.</p>
<p>In early May 2009, a young Finnish computer science student contacted Satoshi: Martti Malmi. He had discovered Bitcoin in early April, started mining, and even wrote a brief description of Bitcoin on the Freedomain Radio forum, where he supported the anarchist notion that peer-to-peer money could make the state obsolete<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>. In his email to Satoshi, he wrote:</p>

<p>Despite his lack of experience, Martti became the main contributor to Bitcoin after Satoshi in the following months. Being a student, he had ample time to devote to the project.</p>
<p>In particular, Satoshi entrusted him with managing the website. As early as May, Martti Malmi drafted an initial description on SourceForge, presenting Bitcoin as an “anonymous digital currency based on a peer-to-peer network” that allows “easy money transfer over the internet without having to trust third parties” and is “safe from instability caused by fractional reserve systems and poor central bank policies<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>.” This draft served as the basis for the presentation of Bitcoin on the website.</p>

People testing the system simply ran the software to “generate coins.” Transactions were scarce and often involved self-transfers. Bitcoins were seen as collectibles reserved for computer enthusiasts. Users felt they were contributing to something, akin to distributed computing projects (known as “<span class="citation" data-cites="home">@home</span>”) where people share their computing resources for good causes.</p>
<p>Some individuals mined continuously. This included Hal Finney, who ran the software between January and March; James Howells, who validated blocks between February and April; Dustin Trammell, who kept his servers running for over a year; and Martti Malmi, who began using his laptop from April onward. But the main miner in 2009 was Satoshi, who deployed significantly more computing power, accounting for nearly half of the network’s block production.</p>
<p>In 2009, the mining difficulty was set at 1, requiring all network nodes to perform approximately 4.3 billion calculations to mine a block—a substantial task for a processor. Consequently, production was slower than anticipated: between January 9, 2009, and January 9, 2010, only 33,802 blocks were found out of the expected 52,560, corresponding to an average time between blocks of 15 minutes and 30 seconds instead of the planned 10 minutes. August 2009 was particularly slow, with only 1,564 out of 4,464 expected blocks found, averaging 28 minutes and 30 seconds per block!</p>

<p>Despite its modest launch, Bitcoin survived the summer and reached a crucial milestone in October: its unit of account acquired a price. An individual using the pseudonym NewLibertyStandard (NLS), new to the community, set up a service on his personal page allowing people to convert dollars into bitcoins and vice versa. To estimate the exchange rate, he based it on the energy cost required to obtain a bitcoin, considering the electricity cost at his location and his personal production rate. Daily prices were published on his site.</p>
<p>On October 12, 2009, the first sale of bitcoins for dollars took place between Martti Malmi and NewLibertyStandard: Martti sold 5,050 bitcoins to NLS for $5.02, deposited into his PayPal account—approximately $0.001 per bitcoin<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>. NLS conducted additional exchanges in the following months, serving as the sole gateway between the dollar and bitcoin.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn26"><p><sup>26</sup>&nbsp;“I found the earliest known bitcoin transaction in USD in my email backups.

This forum became the central hub for Bitcoin discussions from that point. It would be renamed Bitcointalk in August 2011 and moved to a new address.</p>
<p>On December 16, 2009, Satoshi announced the release of version 0.2 of the software, for which Martti Malmi received significant credit, marking the end of the first phase of Bitcoin’s software development. The year ended on a high note when the mining difficulty finally increased, rising from 1 to 1.18 on December 30.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2010, bitcoin was designated a “cryptocurrency” on the website. The prefix “crypto-” (from the ancient Greek κρυπτός, kruptós, meaning hidden or secret) had a dual significance: it referred to the cryptography on which Bitcoin relied and to confidentiality, as Bitcoin was then presented as an “anonymous digital currency.”</p>
<p>This new term confirmed Bitcoin’s central goal: to become a currency—an intermediary in exchanges. This required people to generate transactions (through commerce) and others to process these transactions (through mining). Naturally, the expansion of these two complementary aspects occurred at that time.</p>
<p>The first development was commercial growth, with NewLibertyStandard considered a pioneer. Not only was he the first merchant to accept bitcoin as payment via his exchange service, but he was also one of the original promoters of building this economy. In his first message on the forum on January 19, 2010, he wrote:</p>
<p>“People have bought and sold bitcoins from me. Supply and demand, even if small, already exist, and that’s all it takes. Offering to trade bitcoins for another currency is ultimately no different from exchanging bitcoins for goods or services. Currencies are goods, and exchange is a service. […] You can buy all my dollars or bitcoins today, but there will always be more tomorrow and the day after. Everyone who buys or sells goods using bitcoins, including exchangers, advances the Bitcoin economy. Let everyone do their part. Buy or sell something in exchange for bitcoins!<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>”</p>

NLS proposed that bitcoin, like currencies traded on the forex market, adopt the ticker symbol BTC and the Thai baht symbol. The use of the BTC symbol quickly became standardized. The symbol—a capital B crossed by two vertical lines, unmistakably reminiscent of the dollar sign—was designed by Satoshi himself, inspired by NLS’s proposal, when he created Bitcoin’s first real logo<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Sellers of goods and services also appeared. Beyond his exchange service, NLS opened an online store offering stamps and stickers. Other services accepting bitcoin emerged, including the VoIP service Link2VoIP, web host Vekja.net, and domain name seller Privacy Shark. Additionally, the first poker game involving bitcoins was organized, marking the beginning of the strong relationship between gambling and cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>In April 2010, MyBitcoin was launched—a custodial web application allowing for easy and secure use of Bitcoin, especially on mobile devices. With it, users didn’t need to download the complete data to send and receive transactions or manage their bitcoins by backing up private keys. At the time, lightweight wallets didn’t exist, so even Satoshi considered it acceptable to use such applications, despite going against Bitcoin’s fundamental principle of disintermediation:</p>

Until then, miners used their central processing units (CPUs) to extract new bitcoins. However, these processors proved inefficient for repetitive operations compared to graphics cards, which were much better suited for such tasks. Consequently, everyone knew this evolution was inevitable, including Satoshi, who declared in December 2009 that the community should “agree to delay the GPU arms race as long as possible for the good of the network<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.”</p>
<p>This shift was initiated by Laszlo Hanyecz, a 28-year-old American developer of Hungarian origin who discovered Bitcoin in April. After buying bitcoins from NLS and experimenting with the transaction system, he programmed mining software in early May that leveraged graphics cards. This optimization allowed him to quickly take a significant role in block production. This caught the attention of Satoshi Nakamoto, who contacted him and asked him to slow down his operations to keep mining accessible to everyone:</p>
<p>“One of the main attractions for new users is that anyone with a computer can generate free coins. When there are 5,000 users, this incentive may fade, but for now, it’s still true. GPUs would prematurely limit this incentive to those with high-end GPU hardware. It’s inevitable that GPU compute clusters will eventually dominate all generated coins, but I don’t want to hasten that day. […] I don’t want to come across as a socialist; I don’t care about wealth concentration, but for now, we gain more growth by giving this money to 100% of people rather than 20%<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>.”</p>

With his method, he accumulated tens of thousands of bitcoins.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t entirely negative for the project, as he eventually reinvested his bitcoins into the economy in the most emblematic way: by purchasing something—with pizzas, specifically. On May 18, 2010, he posted the following offer on the forum:</p>
<p>“I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas… maybe two large ones so I have some leftover for the next day. I like having leftover pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to me or order it for me from a delivery service, but my goal is to get food delivered in exchange for bitcoins that I don’t have to order or prepare myself.

On May 22, a young Californian named Jeremy Sturdivant agreed to the exchange via the IRC messaging service: he ordered two Papa John’s pizzas to be delivered to Laszlo in Jacksonville, Florida, and received 10,000 bitcoins in return<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>, worth about $44 on Bitcoin Market at the time. This completed the first purchase of a physical good with bitcoins! This symbolic event would be commemorated annually on this date as <em>Bitcoin Pizza Day</em>.</p>
<p>Another individual contributed to the project’s success. Toward the end of May, Gavin Andresen, a 44-year-old American developer, discovered Bitcoin through an article published in InfoWorld. Having recently returned from Australia and temporarily unemployed, he began working on his first project: a bitcoin faucet that gave bitcoins to anyone who requested them. On June 11, Gavin launched his service and presented it on the forum:</p>
<p>“For my first programming project on Bitcoin, I decided to do something that seems really stupid: I created a website that gives away bitcoins. […] Why? Because I want the Bitcoin project to succeed, and I think it has a better chance if people can get a handful of coins to try it out<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>.”</p>

Moreover, Gavin became involved in software development and corresponded extensively with Satoshi via email. He quickly became Satoshi’s right-hand man, earning his trust.</p>
<p>Despite encouraging economic growth, network activity remained extremely limited. On June 30, on the Bitcoin mailing list, James A. Donald declared that “Bitcoin is somewhat dead” and that “the problem is that bitcoin needs an ecology of users to be useful<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>.” However, a few days later, an event would prove him wrong.</p>

<section id="le-slashdotting" class="level2 unnumbered page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="le-slashdotting">The Slashdot Effect</h2>
<p>On July 11, 2010, following the release of version 0.3 of the software, a brief introduction to Bitcoin written by a user was published on Slashdot—a popular news site covering topics for tech enthusiasts like computing, video games, science, and the internet. The promotional pitch was:</p>
<p>“What do you think of this disruptive technology? Bitcoin is a digital currency based on a peer-to-peer network, with no central bank and no transaction fees. Using a proof-of-work concept, nodes burn CPU cycles to search for coin blocks and broadcast their results to the network. Energy consumption analysis reveals that the market value of bitcoins already exceeds the value of the energy required to generate them, indicating healthy demand. The community is hopeful that the currency will remain beyond any government’s reach<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn37"><p><sup>37</sup>&nbsp;Teppy, “<em>Bitcoin Releases Version 0.3</em>”, <em>Slashdot</em>, July 11, 2010: <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/10/07/11/1747245/Bitcoin-Releases-Version-03" class="uri">https://news.slashdot.org/story/10/07/11/1747245/Bitcoin-Releases-Version-03</a>.</p></div></div><p>This caused a massive influx of new visitors to the site and forum, along with an increase in users and miners on the network. The network held up despite the surge in activity. Consequently, the price of bitcoin experienced its first major rise, jumping from $0.008 to $0.08 in a week—a tenfold increase!</p>
<p>Among those who discovered Bitcoin through Slashdot was Jed McCaleb, a 35-year-old American entrepreneur and programmer known for co-founding and developing the peer-to-peer file-sharing software eDonkey2000 in the 2000s. Noting how cumbersome it was to obtain bitcoins in exchange for dollars, he decided to create a specialized marketplace. He repurposed one of his earlier projects from 2007: <em>Magic The Gathering Online eXchange</em> (MTGOX), a website for buying and selling cards from the online game <em>Magic: The Gathering Online</em><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>. He reused the same domain name: mtgox.com.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn38"><p><sup>38</sup>&nbsp;Gwern Branwen, <em>2014 Jed McCaleb MtGox interview</em>, February 16, 2014: <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/bitcoin/2014-mccaleb" class="uri">https://www.gwern.net/docs/bitcoin/2014-mccaleb</a>.</p></div><div id="fn39"><p><sup>39</sup>&nbsp;Jed McCaleb, <em>Re: New Bitcoin Exchange</em>, 07/18/2010 02:53:07 UTC: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=444.msg3891#msg3891" class="uri">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=444.msg3891#msg3891</a>.</p></div></div><p>A week later, on July 18, the Mt. Gox (“Mount Gox”) exchange platform was launched and officially announced on the forum by Jed. Leveraging his expertise, he ensured the platform functioned like an automated marketplace, akin to modern online exchanges. It stood out from Bitcoin Market by being “always online, automated,” with a “faster site and dedicated hosting,” and “a nicer interface<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>.” Consequently, Mt. Gox quickly became the primary means of acquiring bitcoins, serving as the reference point for dollar pricing.</p>
<p>Mining also entered a growth phase. The influx of new miners pushed the network’s hashing power (the number of calculations per second) above one billion calculations per second (1 GH/s) by July 13. Some miners developed their own GPU mining algorithms. One such miner, known as ArtForz, a German developer, began mining on July 19 and gradually built the first Bitcoin mining farm, later dubbed the “ArtFarm”<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn40"><p><sup>40</sup>&nbsp;On August 13, 2010, ArtForz’s mining farm consisted of six ATI Radeon HD 5770 graphics cards; eventually, it grew to include 24 ATI Radeon HD 5970 cards.—Tim Swanson, <em>How ArtForz changed the history of Bitcoin mining</em>, April 20, 2014: <a href="https://www.ofnumbers.com/2014/04/20/how-artforz-changed-the-history-of-bitcoin-mining/" class="uri">https://www.ofnumbers.com/2014/04/20/how-artforz-changed-the-history-of-bitcoin-mining/</a>.</p></div></div><p>However, this growth following the Slashdot article also led to technical challenges, testing the system’s resilience. Two incidents disrupted the project.</p>
<p>The first was the discovery of a vulnerability in Bitcoin’s code that allowed spending bitcoins from any address (later called the “1 RETURN bug” after the script needed to exploit it). ArtForz discovered this flaw at the end of July 2010. Instead of exploiting it to seize wealth on the network for personal gain, he chose to inform Satoshi and Gavin via email. Satoshi swiftly included a fix in the 0.3.6 update and recommended all users update their software. The vulnerability wasn’t exploited, allowing Bitcoin to avoid a potential disaster.</p>
<p>The second event was the “value overflow incident.” On August 15 around 5 PM, a mined block contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins. This creation exploited an overflow vulnerability in Bitcoin’s quantity representation. An hour later, the issue was spotted by Jeff Garzik, an American engineer who had discovered Bitcoin through Slashdot, who alerted the community on the forum<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn41"><p><sup>41</sup>&nbsp;Jeff Garzik, <em>Strange block 74638</em>, 08/15/2010 18:08:49 UTC: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.msg9474#msg9474" class="uri">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.msg9474#msg9474</a>.</p></div><div id="fn42"><p><sup>42</sup>&nbsp;Satoshi Nakamoto, <em>Development of alert system</em>, 08/22/2010 23:55:06 UTC: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=898.msg10722#msg10722" class="uri">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=898.msg10722#msg10722</a>.

Shortly before midnight, he released a fix that created an alternative chain excluding the problematic transaction. The conflict was resolved when the correct chain became longer than the other the next morning at 8:10 AM. This incident disrupted network activity for about 15 hours, but the problem was quickly resolved thanks to the community’s swift action. Following this incident, Satoshi implemented an alert system in Bitcoin to warn all network nodes of technical issues<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the fall, the growing popularity of GPU mining rendered CPU mining nearly obsolete. This led to the creation of the first mining pool on November 27, Bitcoin.cz Mining—a cooperative allowing small miners to stabilize their income by pooling their computing power<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>. Founded by Marek Palatinus (known as slush), a Czech IT architect, the cooperative would later be renamed Slush Pool in his honor.</p>

These developments showed that the incentives for the system’s various participants were aligned. It was at this point that Satoshi decided to disappear.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="la-disparition-de-satoshi-nakamoto">The Disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto</h2>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto’s departure occurred gradually from December 2010 onward. He didn’t explicitly state his reasons for stepping back, but we can infer them. First, the project had gained momentum—it had grown to the point where leading it became challenging. More importantly, Satoshi feared the reaction of government agencies, a concern he expressed in a message dated July 5, 2010 (commenting on the draft Bitcoin presentation proposed for Slashdot), where he stated he didn’t want to overly highlight Bitcoin’s “anonymous” aspect or its opposition to legal authorities, as it would be a “provocation<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn44"><p><sup>44</sup>&nbsp;“We don’t want to oversell the ‘anonymous’ aspect.

WikiLeaks is a non-profit, non-governmental organization founded by cypherpunk Julian Assange in 2006, aimed at providing a platform for whistleblowers and leaks while protecting their sources. Starting in 2010, confidential documents revealed by the NGO began gaining traction in major media outlets and influencing public opinion. Notably, the <em>Afghan War Diary</em>—a collection of secret U.S. military documents and reports on the war in Afghanistan, revealing, among other things, the concealment of civilian casualties—was published on July 25, 2010, thanks to contributions from Bradley Manning, a U.S. Army intelligence analyst<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>. Similarly, the <em>Iraq War Logs</em> were published on October 23, revealing civilian casualties and acts of torture from the 2004–2009 period.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks relied heavily on public donations for funding—a sensitive activity for regulated firms wary of potential government retaliation. On October 14, 2010, the online payment company Moneybookers froze the NGO’s account. Following these revelations, it became increasingly likely that WikiLeaks would face more sanctions.</p>
<p>On November 10, Amir Taaki, a young Englishman of Iranian origin who had recently discovered Bitcoin, saw an opportunity in WikiLeaks’ situation to demonstrate Bitcoin’s resistance to censorship. He posted on the forum:</p>
<p>“I wanted to send a letter to Wikileaks about Bitcoin because, unfortunately, they have had several incidents where their funds have been seized in the past.

<p>A month later, on December 3, PayPal froze WikiLeaks’ account. Some forum members suggested encouraging WikiLeaks to accept bitcoin, noting it was the “ideal time to set up bitcoin donations<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.” This prompted Satoshi to react the next day, opposing the idea:</p>

<p>“It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>.”</p>

The next day, he posted his final message on the forum to announce version 0.3.19 of the software, then disappeared.

<p>Martti Malmi inherited the website and forum. However, like Satoshi, he gradually distanced himself from Bitcoin, delegating management of these platforms to others, to whom he fully relinquished control in 2015<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>.

On December 19, he announced he was “starting to lead the Bitcoin project more actively<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>” and created the Bitcoin GitHub repository, where the project would be developed going forward. He was unaware that he had become the lead developer and that Bitcoin’s creator was about to vanish.</p>
<p>Satoshi disappeared entirely during the spring of 2011. On April 23, he sent a final email to Mike Hearn, the Google engineer who had approached him two years earlier and maintained contact. He wrote:</p>
<p>“I’ve moved on to other things. [Bitcoin] is in good hands with Gavin and everyone<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>.” He also bid farewell to Gavin and Martti, requesting that Gavin avoid portraying him as a “shadowy figure” to the press<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>. On April 27, Gavin announced he had been invited by the CIA to give a presentation on Bitcoin—a visit that took place on June 14.

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="la-communaute-prend-le-relai">The Community Takes Over</h2>
<p>As Satoshi gradually withdrew, Bitcoin’s popularity soared. Notably, the price of bitcoin rose favorably: from just 20 cents in December 2010, it reached parity with the dollar on February 9, 2011, and maintained it for some time. This price increase fueled enthusiasm within the community, including Hal Finney, who expressed feeling “very fortunate to have invested early in a new phenomenon that could be explosive<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>.”</p>

Launched at the end of January by a young Texan named Ross Ulbricht, he mentioned it on the Bitcoin forum while pretending to have discovered the site by chance<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Ross Ulbricht was deeply committed to libertarian principles—a philosophy advocating for individual freedom, property rights, and free markets. For him, Silk Road embodied this ideal. Consequently, the range of products and services allowed on the site was limited and required that no harm be done to others: items included drugs, medications, precious metal coins, but excluded stolen credit cards, child pornography, or assassination services. The site primarily facilitated the sale of illicit drugs, especially small quantities of cannabis, for which it became notorious.</p>
<p>Promotion of Bitcoin also intensified. On March 22, the first video explaining Bitcoin in qualitative terms was released<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>. Simply titled “What is Bitcoin?”, the video was produced by Stefan Thomas through community crowdfunding. Over the years, it achieved significant success, garnering several million views on YouTube. Similar videos multiplied thereafter.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn64"><p><sup>64</sup>&nbsp;WeUseCoins, <em>What is Bitcoin?</em> (video), March 22, 2011: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo</a>.</p></div></div><p>Bitcoin was especially celebrated in libertarian circles, where its free, anonymous, and state-resistant attributes were emphasized. At the end of 2010, the webradio show FreeTalkLive began discussing Bitcoin and its illicit uses. This caught the attention of entrepreneur and activist Roger Ver, already a millionaire from his computer component resale company, Memory Dealers. He learned about Bitcoin in December 2010 and was instantly captivated. He devoured all available information, bought bitcoins, and arranged for his company to accept them a few months later. He quickly became one of Bitcoin’s most zealous promoters, earning the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus” for a time.</p>
<p>The existence of Silk Road was revealed to the public on June 1, 2011, through an article by Adrian Chen in <em>Gawker</em><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>. This drew even more attention to Bitcoin, particularly by encouraging consumers to acquire bitcoins to shop on the platform.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn65"><p><sup>65</sup>&nbsp;Adrian Chen, “<em>The Underground Website Where You Can Buy Any Drug Imaginable</em>”, <em>Gawker</em>, June 1, 2011: <a href="https://www.gawker.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160" class="uri">https://www.gawker.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160</a>; archive: <a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160" class="uri">https://www.gawkerarchives.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160</a>.</p></div></div><p>During spring 2011, a significant surge in bitcoin’s price occurred due to increased demand. After stagnating for a few months, the price rose from $1 on April 15 to over $32 on June 8.</p>
<p>Mt. Gox, the main exchange platform at the time, came under pressure. Having been taken over a few months earlier by Mark Karpelès—a 26-year-old French developer living in Japan who was somewhat negligent and hadn’t resolved implementation issues from his predecessor—an unfortunate incident occurred on Sunday, June 19. Hackers accessed Jed McCaleb’s administrator account and attempted to extract as much money as possible.</p>
<p>With the daily withdrawal limit set at $1,000, the hackers aimed to crash the price to withdraw as many bitcoins as possible. They sold Jed McCaleb’s bitcoins on the market, causing a flash crash: the price, which had been around $17 that day, plummeted to $0.01 within minutes. Panic ensued, and many Mt. Gox users sold off to salvage what they could. The situation was stabilized by day’s end, but 2,000 bitcoins were unaccounted for. On June 23, Mark Karpelès demonstrated the company’s solvency by moving 424,242 bitcoins from one address to another<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn66"><p><sup>66</sup>&nbsp;The transaction identifier for Mt. Gox’s 2011 solvency proof was 3a1b9e330d32fef1ee42f8e86420d2be978bbe0dc5862f17da9027cf9e11f8c4.</p></div></div><p>This incident marked the end of the speculative frenzy, and the price began a gradual decline. Around this time, MyBitcoin shut down: in early August, the service went bankrupt following the disappearance of 78,740 bitcoins—51% of client funds. Evidence suggested that its anonymous founder, Tom Williams, orchestrated the theft. In the days following, the price steeply dropped to $6 and eventually fell to $2 by November.</p>
<p>Despite these setbacks, community members remained undeterred. From August 19 to 21, 2011, the first Bitcoin conference was held in New York, organized by Bruce Wagner, host of <em>The Bitcoin Show</em>, a program featuring interviews with ecosystem participants<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>. The conference had an amateur feel, typical of the community at the time, with only four presentations: those by Bruce Wagner, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, and Stefan Thomas. Nonetheless, it allowed key figures like Roger Ver, Jesse Powell, Jed McCaleb, Mark Karpelès, and Charlie Lee to meet in person for the first time.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn67"><p><sup>67</sup>&nbsp;Bruce Wagner’s YouTube channel is available at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@vlogwrap" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/@vlogwrap</a>.

Previously centralized under Satoshi’s “benevolent dictatorship,” development opened to community contributions under Gavin Andresen’s supervision following Satoshi’s departure. Talented contributors began influencing Bitcoin’s evolution, including Nils Schneider, Matt Corallo, Pieter Wuille, Jeff Garzik, Wladimir van der Laan, Luke-Jr, and Gregory Maxwell. Coordination methods were established, such as the bitcoin-development mailing list for formal discussions<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> and the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) system to publicly outline changes<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Using Bitcoin became easier. Lightweight wallets emerged, allowing users to transact without downloading and verifying the entire blockchain. These wallets utilized Simplified Payment Verification, described by Satoshi Nakamoto in section 8 of the white paper. Mike Hearn implemented this in his Java-based library BitCoinJ, improving compatibility with Android smartphones. The first mobile wallet, <em>Bitcoin Wallet for Android</em>, was launched by Andreas Schildbach in March 2011, demonstrating everyday usability. On desktops, Thomas Voegtlin created Electrum in November 2011, offering wallet recovery through a mnemonic phrase—a practice later standardized across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, decentralized development also led to tensions. Without its founder, the project lacked an undisputed leader. While Gavin Andresen controlled the repository, he didn’t have the technical authority to unilaterally impose his views. Decisions were made collectively, raising questions about Bitcoin’s governance: who decides protocol changes?</p>
<p>At the end of 2011 and early 2012, the first technical debate without Satoshi occurred. Though the developer group was small, a conflict arose over improving transaction programmability to enable multi-signature accounts—a debate remembered as the “battle for P2SH<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>.”</p>

However, these scripts are complex to manage. A need arose for a simple way for users to send funds to a recipient-defined script. Nicolas van Saberhagen proposed adding a new opcode called OP_EVAL. This proposal had recursion issues, leading to two competing proposals: Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) by Gavin Andresen and OP_CHECKHASHVERIFY (CHV) by Luke-Jr.</p>
<p>Tension between these proposals sparked debate. Amir Taaki, supporting neither, called for open discussion on January 29, 2012:</p>
<p>“My fear is that one day Bitcoin will be corrupted. Developers: consider this additional scrutiny as an opportunity to build a culture of openness<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>.”</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Bitcoin’s popularization continued. On February 28, Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin, just 18, co-founded <em>Bitcoin Magazine</em> with Romanian developer Mihai Alisie. Initially a web-only publication, it began print distribution in May. Vitalik authored numerous articles documenting current events. Other specialized news sites like CoinDesk and CoinTelegraph soon emerged.</p>
<p>On April 24, 2012, entrepreneur Erik Voorhees launched SatoshiDICE, an online gambling game<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>. Players sent bitcoins to specific addresses, with predefined probabilities of receiving rewards—a straightforward, verifiable process that attracted many gamblers.</p>

On August 20, he even conducted an IPO for his company on the Romanian platform MPEx. He sold the platform on July 17, 2013, for 126,315 bitcoins, worth $12.4 million at the time.</p>
<p>SatoshiDICE’s success significantly increased blockchain transactions, tripling them in months. This surge, primarily from the site, was noted and even labeled as “spam” by some developers<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>.

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="lamorçage-organique-de-bitcoin">The Organic Bootstrapping of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin’s early years were pivotal for its success. It grew discreetly, experiencing organic and cautious development, sheltered from opportunism and propaganda.</p>
<p>Proposed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto and implemented in January 2009, Bitcoin’s beginnings were challenging—it took nine months for bitcoin to acquire a price! Satoshi devoted himself entirely to his creation without ever leveraging his accumulated fortune personally. By disappearing in 2011, he ultimately entrusted the community with the project.</p>
<p>Forged in a crucible of cypherpunks, anarchists, libertarians, and other freedom enthusiasts, Bitcoin was built in opposition to the traditional state-banking system dominated by censorship and public bailouts. This is why Bitcoin’s message is so radical, inspiring passion in many.</p>
<p>Between 2010 and 2012, Bitcoin’s first use cases emerged: funding politically sensitive projects, online gambling, remote drug purchases, remittances abroad—activities at the edge of legality or outright illegal—demonstrating bitcoin’s effectiveness as an uncensorable and relatively anonymous currency. This trend was quickly tempered, as seen in subsequent years.</p>
