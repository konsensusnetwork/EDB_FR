<p><span class="lettrine">S</span><span class="smallcaps">atoshi</span> Nakamoto’s discovery of Bitcoin marks a profound conceptual revolution in monetary systems. This explains why, since 2008, it has ignited intense passions among both its supporters and critics. Some have seen it as the solution to all the world’s problems—a universal currency destined to replace gold and all fiat money without opposition. Others have tried to depict it as a harmful, polluting scheme of organized fraud, expressing an instinctive rejection characteristic of the institutions they represented.</p>
<p>In this book, we have aimed to offer a balanced perspective by thoroughly exploring where Bitcoin comes from, the challenges it faces, and the principles that underpin it. Due to its design, Bitcoin stands as a remarkably elegant tool whose mechanisms warrant detailed examination—a task we have undertaken here. By way of conclusion, let’s recap what we have explored before turning our attention to Bitcoin’s future.</p>
<section id="the-elegance-of-bitcoin" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="the-elegance-of-bitcoin">The Elegance of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>To begin with, it’s important to remember that Bitcoin didn’t appear out of thin air. It’s the product of technological advancements during the latter half of the 20th century, heavily reliant on personal computers, asymmetric cryptography, and the Internet. Ideologically, it draws from diverse movements such as agorism, open-source advocacy, and extropianism, all of which emphasized practical action over mere theorizing. Specifically, it evolved from the cypherpunk movement, which, starting in the early 1990s, endorsed the proactive use of cryptography to safeguard privacy and individual rights in the emerging cyberspace. Thus, the fundamental value underpinning Bitcoin is freedom.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bitcoin is the culmination of an extensive pursuit of digital currency, a quest notably championed by the cypherpunks. It owes a debt to Chaum’s eCash system, which enjoyed brief prominence in the mid-1990s before disappearing. It also takes cues from private digital currency endeavors such as Liberty Dollar, e-gold, and Liberty Reserve, all of which were halted by governments in the early 21st century. Bitcoin aligns with the lineage of decentralized currency concepts like b-money, Bit Gold, RPOW, and, to some degree, Ripple.</p>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto conceived Bitcoin in 2007, publishing its seminal white paper on October 31, 2008, before finalizing the prototype and launching the network in January 2009. Following a rocky beginning, the cryptocurrency gradually emerged from obscurity, drawing in individuals intrigued by its potential. These pioneers contributed to Bitcoin’s growth by engaging in software development, mining, and commerce. Once the project was fully launched in 2010, Satoshi gradually vanished, handing over control to his trusted collaborators. To this day, his anonymity remains intact.</p>
<p>With the founder gone, the community had to self-organize. This era saw the first conferences, initial debates about the protocol’s future, and the development of the earliest lightweight wallets. However, the decentralization of Bitcoin’s development eliminated any singular dominant perspective, leading to numerous conflicts, beginning with the P2SH controversy in 2011–2012. Four significant divides surfaced: first, financialization—the partial reintroduction of trusted third parties; second, scaling issues—deciding between increasing the blockchain’s transaction capacity or employing layer-two solutions; third, the emergence of alternative cryptocurrencies, fiercely criticized by some and welcomed by others; and fourth, institutional integration—whether to cooperate with or oppose authority. These conflicts have shaped Bitcoin into what it is today.</p>
<p>Bitcoin represents a new form of currency. It is a medium of exchange with distributed management, meaning it doesn’t depend on a central authority. Although its resistance to change aligns it somewhat with tangible goods, Bitcoin isn’t a commodity currency since its attributes don’t derive from intrinsic physical properties. Even though it shares the digital nature of the banking system, it’s not a ledger-based currency, as its ledger entries don’t represent claims. While it lacks significant non-monetary uses, it’s not centralized fiat money because it doesn’t depend on trust in a single actor. Ultimately, Bitcoin falls into a new category and can be described as a network currency or distributed fiat currency, meaning it disperses trust across a network of nodes operated by merchants rather than concentrating it with a single entity.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system” enabling “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without the need for a financial institution.” It represents a digital currency concept resistant to censorship and inflation, making it challenging to obstruct transactions or create additional units. Bitcoin is a tool naturally suited to the margins, operating at the boundary of legality, and sometimes beyond. It’s a currency of dissent, employed by political activists, whistleblowers, and organizations that challenge authority. It’s a currency of freedom for censored individuals—those whose professions are considered deviant, who dare to voice dissenting opinions, or who were unfortunate enough to be born in the wrong country. It’s a black-market currency utilized by the underground economy, particularly in acts of tax resistance.</p>
<p>This role as a currency of freedom puts it at odds with the state, which inherently seeks continual expansion, particularly by tightening its grip on money. By supervising banking, the state has altered the foundation of money, shifting it from precious metals to fiat coins and bills. It could repeat this by converting physical currency into a central bank digital currency accessible to all, subject to pervasive surveillance and censorship. This predatory stance of the state underpins Bitcoin’s distributed architecture, which disperses risks among system participants, endowing it with unprecedented robustness.</p>
<p>Bitcoin relies on several technical components to operate effectively. The foremost is digital signatures, which secure ownership within the system. Users truly own their bitcoins by exercising exclusive control over their private keys. This mechanism grants the unique freedom of sovereignly managing digital funds but also demands responsibility concerning loss and theft—risks absent when dealing with a trusted third party.</p>
<p>To prevent double-spending, Bitcoin employs an innovative consensus algorithm that updates a chain of time-stamped transaction blocks through a proof-of-work process. Its open and robust operation sets it apart from traditional consensus algorithms previously used in distributed systems. Nakamoto’s brilliance lay in sacrificing some security (rendering it probabilistic rather than absolute) to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance. This model hinges on miners’ economic incentives—they find it more profitable to mine the chain legitimately than to attack it.</p>
<p>However, the genius of Bitcoin’s design doesn’t stop there. It not only discourages double-spending but also combats financial censorship—a significant issue in today’s digital transactions. Censorship in Bitcoin involves mining a longer chain that omits undesirable transactions. Thanks to integrated transaction fees and the external nature of proof-of-work, such suppression can be effectively contested, aligning with the model’s resistance to censorship.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is an open and free concept of currency, inherently dynamic and multifaceted. Consequently, a variety of Bitcoin implementations exist, influenced by two opposing effects: network effect and substitution effect. The monetary nature of Bitcoin suggests that only a few implementations can survive, while its lack of scalability implies that multiple versions may persist.</p>
<p>Determining the protocol—or protocols—is an economic process driven by merchants’ acceptance of the currency. Merchants play the most crucial role by having the final say on consensus rules through their economic activity verified by their nodes. More broadly, the governance model is sociologically complex; merchants are influenced by other system participants like customers, holders, developers, and miners, as well as external actors such as opinion leaders, financial powers, and the state.</p>
<p>Resistance to inflation—or the difficulty in creating more bitcoins—emerges from the economic dynamics opposing changes to monetary policy. It doesn’t stem from a lack of community unanimity or Satoshi Nakamoto’s original establishment of the monetary policy. The emblematic 21 million limit isn’t absolute; it depends at every moment on merchants’ decisions.</p>
<p>Technically, Bitcoin is optimized for currency use, as evidenced by its unit representation model based on coins rather than accounts like Ethereum. While no advanced techniques were integrated into the prototype, Bitcoin is also designed for privacy, as preserving privacy is essential for currency fungibility and resistance to censorship.</p>
<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is programmable, allowing spending conditions to be imposed on different coins. This modular aspect of transactions enables strangers to exchange value as confidentially and securely as possible. It’s also the foundation for layer-two protocols like the Lightning Network, which increase exchange capacity without compromising the base system’s security.</p>
<p>All these properties make Bitcoin a cohesive whole of rare elegance. Bitcoin is the missing piece of the puzzle for freedom on the Internet. Bitcoin represents the hope of a generation facing ever-growing state authority. Bitcoin embodies the project of a robust and sustainable alternative monetary system, explaining the tremendous momentum it enjoyed in its early years.</p>

<section id="the-four-threats-facing-bitcoin" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="the-four-threats-facing-bitcoin">The Four Threats Facing Bitcoin</h2>
<p>As we’ve discussed throughout this book, Bitcoin isn’t entirely shielded from adversarial attacks. In this section, we’ll outline the main threats looming over Bitcoin today. We’ll avoid technical risks, which have been addressed by more knowledgeable individuals, and focus solely on dangers arising from human behavior—specifically actions by economic actors within the system. In our view, these pose far greater concern.</p>
<p>Human threats are subtle because the attacks they enable often occur suddenly. The increase of these threats resembles a game of musical chairs, where participants naively circle chairs without monitoring them. As long as the music plays, all seems well—the adversary calmly removes chairs one by one, and the circle continues. It’s only when the music stops that problems become apparent.</p>
<p>We identify four such threats that could harm Bitcoin: centralization of economic activity, centralization of mining activity, widespread custodial holdings, and erosion of privacy. These threats aren’t entirely independent but correspond to different behaviors among actors.</p>
<p>The first threat is the centralization of economic activity, emerging through significant commerce conducted via regulated exchanges and the near-universal use of external payment processors and third-party wallet providers. This could lead, as described in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="la-determination-du-protocole.html" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ch:determination">11</a>, to protocol alteration attacks in the form of an inflationary hard fork, a tax-based soft fork, or a censorship soft fork. Such attacks might cause a chain split in one way or another and are especially damaging if the altered chain becomes dominant due to network effects. However, the attack isn’t fatal to the system since the economy can gradually rebuild on the free chain.</p>
<p>The second threat is the centralization of mining activity, evident in the geographical clustering of mining equipment, the grouping of hashers into cooperatives, and miners’ collective use of centralized relay networks. This risk could lead, as seen in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="la-resistance-a-la-censure.html" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ch:censure">9</a>, to transaction censorship attacks by a majority of the network’s computing power. Such an attack is likely to occur after an attempted protocol alteration on the free chain that refused the changes. It effectively paralyzes part of the activity by preventing its confirmation on the chain. The attack benefits from chain analysis to isolate problematic transactions rather than suppress all activity. However, it’s not fatal to the system, as additional mining equipment can be deployed—spurred by increased fees from censored transactions—to restore the initial situation.</p>
<p>The third threat, related to the centralization of economic activity, is the widespread custodial holding of funds by entities adhering to legal regulations. Not only is this practice individually questionable (a custodian can censor transactions, seize funds, and inflate the number of paper bitcoins they distribute), but its proliferation creates systemic risk. This threat manifests today through the growth of institutional custodians like Coinbase Custody holding a significant percentage of circulating bitcoins and the expansion of services targeting small investors. It’s more dangerous than economic centralization because a “hosted” economy cannot reform if there’s a protocol attack—the regulated custodians are the actual bitcoin owners, not their clients. This represents a persistent degradation of the system, harder to rectify than mere mining or commercial centralization.</p>
<p>The fourth, more insidious threat is the erosion of privacy, materializing through widespread surveillance (know-your-customer protocols, proof of address ownership) and, incidentally, accompanying chain analysis. Similar to custodial holding by regulated entities, complete transparency to the state is not only an individual misstep (leaving one unprotected from censorship and seizure) but also a systemic risk if it becomes widespread. Greater surveillance creates a more controllable economy, making the protocol more vulnerable. Additionally, identifying actors reduces the anonymity set benefitting everyone and diminishes the possibility of conducting secret activities. The erosion of privacy thus becomes a subtle system degradation that can only be remedied by combating identification links through good practices like coin mixing.</p>
<p>These threats depend on the actions of Bitcoin’s economic actors, especially its users. To combat them, users should be encouraged to withdraw their bitcoins to personal wallets, avoid compliance with know-your-customer protocols, make their bitcoins untraceable, and use their own nodes—individually or within communities. This is particularly relevant for new users, leading us to the topic of adoption.</p>

<section id="the-two-paths-of-cryptocurrency-adoption" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="the-two-paths-of-cryptocurrency-adoption">The Two Paths of Cryptocurrency Adoption</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is a system based on economic incentives where those who sustain it are rewarded. Miners are incentivized to confirm transactions to earn fees. Merchants are incentivized to verify consensus rules to fully benefit from Bitcoin’s value proposition. Holders are incentivized to promote Bitcoin to expand the economy and enjoy the resulting increase in purchasing power (or dollar price) of the unit of account. This economic expansion, or adoption, is thus a natural goal for those who own bitcoin.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways Bitcoin can be adopted, but two primary models stand out. The first is adoption by individuals and small businesses, representing a modest financial contribution to bitcoin’s aggregate value. The second is adoption by large corporations, brokerage firms, and financial institutions, offering a more significant gain for holders. In the early days, convincing the latter group of bitcoin’s merits was impossible, but with economic development and tailored communication, persuading them to participate has become much easier. Since this adoption was more profitable for holders, many chose the path of least resistance, filling their discourse with language aimed at regulated actors.</p>
<p>However, this second wave of bitcoin adoption, while profitable in the short term and possessing its own merits, tends to become sterile in the long run. It creates a centralized, monitored, and even entirely custodial economy—an economy fragile and at the mercy of governmental decisions. Therefore, we can term it “bad adoption.”</p>
<p>The only adoption worth pursuing is that of a free and independent economy for which Bitcoin is inherently suited. This economy possesses characteristics that allow Bitcoin to endure. It is decentralized, distributing risks among all its members to maximize Bitcoin’s value proposition. It is disobedient, refusing any protocol modifications that would alter Bitcoin’s fundamental properties. It safeguards its privacy, aware that surveillance poses a threat even when no immediate illegal activity is involved. It is circular, minimizing reliance on state-issued money, especially in digital form, sensing that such currency is increasingly controlled. Finally, it is demanding, requiring discernment and responsibility from individuals—qualities often overlooked in our modern era.</p>
<p>However, the constraints of this “good adoption” make it inaccessible to everyone. Not only does sovereign Bitcoin use demand a degree of responsibility, but it also presents significant drawbacks, currently including purchasing power volatility, transaction costs, lack of scalability, and discouraging regulations. Therefore, expecting everyone to adopt bitcoin as their preferred currency in the short or medium term is unrealistic. In other words, mass adoption won’t happen anytime soon, and Bitcoin use will initially remain confined to those seeking to escape the state-banking system and resist the powers that be.</p>
<p>It’s thus illusory to anticipate “hyperbitcoinization,” a rapid replacement of fiat currencies by bitcoin. As long as there exists a mass of people who blindly obey authority, state-issued money will persist. Only necessity might drive this mass to make opportunistic and temporary use of Bitcoin.</p>

<section id="a-culture-in-the-making" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="a-culture-in-the-making">A Culture in the Making</h2>
<p>Culture encompasses the material, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual aspects that characterize societies or social groups. Every enduring human association tends to develop its own culture. The Bitcoin community, though vaguely defined, is no exception. Cultural elements emerged in Bitcoin from its inception and multiplied as the network grew, eventually giving rise to a genuine subculture.</p>
<p>This culture is inherently political, marked by animosity toward authority figures and numerous references to cypherpunks and Austrian economists. It also comprises ritualized monetary practices, hygiene recommendations (notably against dubious crypto-assets), futuristic artworks, books, and various podcasts, gatherings (monthly meetups, conferences), and regular commemorations of events that have shaped cryptocurrency history. The culture of Bitcoin—the Internet’s currency—also heavily relies on concise slogans and humorous memes, particularly suited for propagation on social media.</p>
<p>Culture, especially the religious facet, influences individual actions. Since Bitcoin is a tool whose security depends on how it’s used, this cultural aspect is fundamental. For example, the phrase “not your keys, not your bitcoins,” coined by Andreas Antonopoulos, is far more convincing in encouraging people to store funds in personal wallets than any historical account of platform failures and account freezes. However, culture can also misguide behavior, ultimately harming the system.</p>
<p>As a speculative asset whose price has multiplied 30 million times over 14 years, bitcoin has attracted those eager for financial gain. It boasted absolute scarcity by design—a novelty in history—and it’s natural that this drew attention. This was one of Satoshi Nakamoto’s essential choices, as this speculative appeal partly facilitated the monetization process and introduced Bitcoin to individuals who might have otherwise ignored it.</p>
<p>However, Bitcoin’s culture was profoundly influenced in the process. A genuine trend toward greed emerged within the community, reflected in memes and various slogans. Notably, there’s an underlying assumption that “the number must go up,” propelling the price “to the moon,” based on the notion that the world’s wealth is infinite and there are only 21 million bitcoins (<span class="math inline">\(\infty / 21\mathrm{M}\)</span>). Consequently, individuals should “stack sats” (accumulate satoshis) and “HODL” (hold on for dear life) to benefit from a better future. This mindset is evident in representations of Bitcoin and bitcoiners, such as the bull of the bullish market or laser eyes (#LaserRayUntil100K).</p>
<p>This desire for an ever-higher price relies on the delusion of mass adoption we’ve discussed earlier. For the price to reach lofty heights, everyone must eventually possess bitcoin in some form. Since most people aren’t ready to use Bitcoin sovereignly, this adoption has been facilitated through custodians. Thus, a culture centered on financial gain led to the subtle weakening of Bitcoin by broadly accepting financial intermediaries, consenting to mass identification, and promoting Bitcoin to institutions and states.</p>
<p>Mass adoption isn’t a realistic goal in the short or medium term. When we extol Bitcoin’s virtues, we’re not addressing the masses per se; we’re reaching out to those who understand the issues it solves and might be interested. Therefore, it’s essential not to sanitize the message—to not lose these individuals, we must tell the truth; and while this truth can be veiled, it should never be distorted.</p>
<p>Bitcoin thrives on the tension between the official economy, which approves monetary control, and the counter-economy, which opposes it. Due to this tension, the cryptocurrency culture is constantly under attack, notably by mass media, central bankers, and state representatives. A staggering number of detractors, working for the adversary, tirelessly repeat their disingenuous arguments. While it’s useful to confront them to set the record straight for a doubtful audience, it’s futile to believe they’ll disappear or lose visibility. Therefore, Bitcoin needs a tradition—a cultural transmission from individual to individual—that can organically and healthily explain its principles to newcomers.</p>
<p>Specifically, Bitcoin’s message should always be a call to action, in line with preceding ideological movements like the cypherpunks. Everyone should feel encouraged to write (and read) code, deploy mining farms when possible, participate in the circular economy, hold bitcoin, and educate others on the subject, even if it doesn’t bring direct financial gain. This is also how Bitcoin prospers.</p>
<p>In any case, Bitcoin cannot be forgotten. Satoshi Nakamoto’s discovery is here to stay. It has already played a role in the fight for human freedom and will likely play an even greater role in the future. Its success will depend on the actions of those who support it. The revolution will not be centralized.</p>
