<p><span class="lettrine">B</span><span class="smallcaps">i</span>tcoin provides individuals with full and sovereign ownership of their money. It enables them to send funds to anyone, anywhere in the world, at any time and for any purpose, preventing transactions from being frozen. Additionally, it allows them to fully preserve their purchasing power by prohibiting the arbitrary creation of additional units. Through this dual value proposition, Bitcoin stands in an antagonistic relationship with the State, which claims an exclusive prerogative over currency and inquisitorial control over its use.</p>
<p>Often portrayed as the institution possessing the “monopoly of legitimate violence,” the State is better characterized by the non-consensual transfer of wealth it enforces. This transfer manifests primarily in two ways: taxation, which is the direct levy on taxpayers, and seigniorage, the indirect expropriation of savers through currency issuance. Both methods rely on monetary control: the first is facilitated by the surveillance and blocking of transactions; the second stems from mastery over the definition of the unit of account.</p>
<p>Consequently, the State tolerates no serious monetary competition. As a tool of freedom, Bitcoin challenges this control and thus constitutes a threat from the State’s perspective. This is the raison d’être of its distributed architecture, fundamental to its design.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will first examine the State-organized transfer of wealth and its consequences. Then, we will explore how monetary control has been reinforced throughout history and how it threatens to increase again through central bank digital currencies. Finally, we will explain why centralized alternative systems are not viable and why decentralization is a necessity.</p>
<section id="létat-et-limpôt" class="level2 unnumbered page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="létat-et-limpôt">The State and Taxation</h2>
<p>From a sociological standpoint, the State is traditionally defined as a sovereign authority exercised over a determined territory and a people it officially represents. Three elements characterize it: power over a population, control of a territory, and a certain level of acceptance.</p>
<p>Firstly, the State inherently utilizes physical force: its existence depends on coercion, imposed through violence or the threat of violence, via police and military forces. This force is exerted over a group of people under its dominion, called subjects or citizens, whose natural freedom it restricts, typically through laws and decrees outlining prohibitions. In particular, it levies taxes (a term derived from the Latin <em>impōnō</em>, meaning “to impose” or “to place upon”), which, in effect, are wealth extractions lacking individual consent<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Even if one considers taxation a “necessary evil” or justified by the “general interest” or “democracy,” it remains, by nature, a non-consensual wealth transfer—in blunt terms, theft.</p></div></div><p>Secondly, the State’s authority is enforced through domination over a specific territory. This control allows it to consolidate its wealth extraction within defined borders: since humans need land (or sea) to exercise their abilities, controlling territory greatly facilitates their subjugation. This domination over land explains the feudal organization (from the medieval Latin <em>feodum</em>, meaning “fief”) of the State in agrarian societies.</p>
<p>Today, taxation is collected through numerous controls executed by the State. These controls primarily involve financial surveillance, notably within the banking sector: banks and other financial institutions are accountable to the tax administration, required to report suspicious client information. This surveillance is facilitated by various laws, such as restrictions on cash usage. Within the territory, tax collection relies on fiscal audits, which encompass methods to examine declarations, compare them to actual circumstances, and increase tax bases if necessary. Preserving the State’s tax revenue also involves hindering wealth outflows through customs and capital controls. All these measures closely relate to financial censorship, discussed in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="la-resistance-a-la-censure.html" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ch:censure">9</a> of this work.</p>
<p>Tax collection within the territory primarily occurs through established economic actors, even when they’re not directly taxed. In France, for example, the value-added tax levied on goods and services is paid by the customer but remitted by the merchant, who must include it in the sale price. Similarly, many fiscal charges are withheld at the source by companies but paid by their employees, such as the generalized social contribution and, currently, income tax. This use of “indirect” taxation reduces the number of individuals to monitor and makes the levy “painless” for those who truly bear the cost.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the State benefits from a <em>broad acceptance</em> by the population, ranging from active approval to passive resignation. This acceptance differentiates it from organized criminal groups, which generally lack such legitimacy. Although temporary and partial, this acceptance underpins the concept of a “social contract,” which, rather than being a genuine legal contract, acknowledges the existing situation. Thus, the State derives its name from embodying the current state of power relations within society.</p>
<p>The population’s acceptance ensures the longevity of tax collection, reducing the need for sheer force to maintain authority. The State asserts its legitimacy by claiming to represent the interests of the people living within its territory, employing various ideologies to render contributors compliant and to minimize rebellions.</p>
<p>In particular, the State claims a monopoly on defensive violence<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, guaranteeing internal order (through the police) and defense against external enemies (via the military). This genuine service is not performed altruistically: the State’s interest lies in defending productive forces against internal and external disruptions while preventing them from organizing their own protection, aiming to stabilize its tax revenue. This monopoly resembles protective coercion accepted by the population as a lesser evil.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Max Weber wrote in 1919: “The State is the institution that possesses the monopoly of legitimate violence within a given territory.” — Max Weber, <em>The Scholar and the Politician</em>, 10/18, 2002.</p></div><div id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Article 1747 of the <em>General Tax Code</em> states: “Anyone who, through force, threats, or concerted actions, organizes or attempts to organize the collective refusal to pay taxes shall be punished with the penalties provided in Article 1 of the law of August 18, 1936, repressing attacks on the nation’s credit [i.e., two years’ imprisonment and a €9,000 fine].”</p></div></div><p>Since taxation is the cornerstone of the State’s structure, paying taxes holds a sacred status. This explains why tax avoidance is consistently condemned, even when legal. It’s also why tax resistance is severely repressed, including through restrictions on freedom of expression in this domain. In France, for example, calling for a tax strike is illegal, punishable by a €3,750 fine and six months’ imprisonment<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, the State’s capacity to extract wealth is not limitless. Firstly, there is a delicate balance between the effective level of wealth extraction and the resulting economic destruction, which varies according to the beneficiaries’ time preferences<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Secondly, the level of extraction depends on the population’s acceptance, and there is inevitably a point where raising tax rates reduces total revenue—a phenomenon illustrated by the Laffer curve. Finally, the capacity for extraction depends on the State’s technical means, notably regarding surveillance, and on the tools available to the population for tax resistance, which, of course, include Bitcoin.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;See Hans-Hermann Hoppe, “Time Preference, Government, and the Process of Decivilization,” in <em>Democracy: The God That Failed</em>, 2020, Éditions Résurgence.</p></div></div><p>Thus, the State embodies organized, institutionalized violence, with its primary function being to enforce non-consensual wealth transfer. Rather than a specific group of identified individuals, it should be understood as a series of actions performed by people within a particular context. Therefore, we will refer to the State in the singular, as a concept manifesting in various instances that operate on the same principles.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="la-monnaie-et-le-seigneuriage">Money and Seigniorage</h2>
<p>We discuss the State because it maintains a close relationship with money. As seen in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="des-racines-monetaires.html" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ch:monnaie">3</a>, the State has gradually claimed increasing prerogatives over defining the medium of exchange, initially by guaranteeing its certification and now by controlling its issuance. This situation has led some theorists, including Chartalists, to adopt a fiscal approach to money, viewing tax payment as the original source of its value.</p>
<p>This close relationship is explained by the significant benefit the State derives: seigniorage<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, the direct financial advantage resulting from currency issuance for the issuer. Seigniorage is inherently an indirect expropriation of currency holders, much more effective in the short term than direct taxation. Debt, often cited as a third method, is essentially deferred taxation or disguised seigniorage.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;“Seigniorage” originates from Old French <em>seignorage</em>, referring to the privilege of minting money in the Middle Ages, typically reserved for feudal lords.</p></div><div id="fn6"><p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Jörg Guido Hülsmann, <em>The Ethics of Money Production</em>, Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2008.</p></div></div><p>Seigniorage involves profiting from a specific industry: money production. It results from four fundamental legal measures: legalized counterfeiting, monopoly over production, imposition of legal tender, and suspension of payments<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. Like taxation, these actions are widely accepted because they emanate from public authority.</p>
<p>Legalized counterfeiting involves circulating money whose certification doesn’t match public expectations. Typically, this means issuing coins with less metal content than existing ones or representative notes where the base money held in reserve is fractionally backed.</p>
<p>A monopoly over money production grants exclusive issuance rights to an entity, eliminating competition and allowing it to sell currency at higher prices than in a free market. This privilege is usually delegated to a State-controlled entity, such as a mint or central bank.</p>
<p>Legal tender laws compel economic actors to accept a currency at its nominal value as dictated by the State. This imposition can be limited to deferred payments (as in Anglo-Saxon contexts) or broader, covering all transactions (common in continental Europe<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>). The goal is to favor the State-issued currency by overvaluing it against competitors.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn7"><p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For example, in France, legal tender of cash is mandated by Article R642-3 of the Penal Code: “Refusing to accept coins or banknotes with legal tender status in France at their face value is punishable by a fine for second-class contraventions.”</p></div></div><p>Throughout history, legal tender has taken various forms. It appeared in bimetallism, where the gold-to-silver ratio was arbitrarily fixed, favoring one metal over the other. During the classical gold standard, representative notes had to be exchanged at par with specie. It was also evident in the gold exchange standard, requiring secondary countries’ national currencies to have legal tender at fixed rates against the pound or dollar, maintained artificially through exchange controls. Today, legal tender relates to foreign exchange rates, prohibiting differential pricing based on the medium of exchange used.</p>
<p>Suspension of payments allows a central bank to temporarily halt repayments to clients, leading to forced tender. In the case of representative notes, this legal measure enabled banks to hold less gold in reserve by preventing withdrawals during confidence crises.</p>
<p>From antiquity until the 19th century, money consisted of precious metal coins—primarily gold, silver, and sometimes copper. Thus, sovereigns couldn’t create new units from nothing but could devalue existing coins by reducing their metal content.</p>
<p>In ancient Rome, the silver <em>denarius</em> (origin of the word “denier”) was repeatedly devalued, slowly at first, before its metal content was drastically reduced during the 3rd-century crisis. The seigniorage gained allowed the Roman Empire to continue financing its dominance without further territorial expansion. Similarly, European sovereigns manipulated coinage throughout the Middle Ages. These practices were notably observed by Christian philosopher Nicolas Oresme in the 14th century.</p>
<p>Such manipulation had another unfortunate effect: driving undervalued currency out of circulation, leading it to be hoarded or exported. This phenomenon is known as Gresham’s Law, named after Sir Thomas Gresham, a prominent 16th-century English merchant and financier who linked the disappearance of better-quality silver coins from circulation to contemporary legal measures<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. Commonly summarized as “bad money drives out good,” the law states that when a fixed legal exchange rate exists between two currencies, the overvalued (bad) currency tends to replace the undervalued (good) one in commerce. This principle also applies, to a lesser extent, to representative and fiat money.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn8"><p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Gresham’s Law was formalized by Scottish economist Henry Dunning Macleod in his <em>Elements of Political Economy</em> (1858).</p></div></div><p>The rise of modern banks during the Renaissance led to the emergence of convertible banknotes, making value transfer more convenient. Authorities co-opted this innovation by monopolizing banknote issuance, turning them into supposed representative instruments.</p>
<p>In this context, seigniorage involved creating more banknotes than there was precious metal in reserve—a form of financial fraud. However, a significant portion of metal still had to be kept to prevent creditors from emptying vaults. While the State could suspend payments (as it did historically), such actions led to drastic loss of confidence in banknotes relative to the metal they represented. This constraint kept the gold standard relatively stable monetarily but paved the way for a more inflationary regime: paper money.</p>
<p>Seigniorage gained prominence with the advent of paper money—a physical form of fiat currency. It became as simple as creating more banknotes mandated for use within the territory, far more efficient than devaluing coins or committing fraud with representative notes.</p>
<p>From its inception, paper money financed grand State projects, notably modern warfare. For instance, the issuance of American <em>greenbacks</em> (named for their green-inked reverse) between 1861 and 1865 supported the Civil War efforts. Similarly, World War I was largely financed through monetary creation and inflation-induced debt reduction.</p>
<p>To prevent excessive flight to more reliable competing currencies, States implemented exchange controls regulating foreign currency transactions, maintaining artificially high currency values despite collapsing confidence. The common pretext was combating “speculation.”</p>
<p>However, even with paper money’s unprecedented benefits, the ability to profit wasn’t unlimited: producing coins and banknotes and combating private counterfeiting incurred unavoidable costs that reduced seigniorage. This partly explains the current push to replace physical cash with entirely digital money.</p>
<p>Finally, like taxation, seigniorage depends on public acceptance, bolstered by restricting free expression. In France, for example, it’s illegal to undermine public confidence in the currency; violators face a €9,000 fine and two years in prison<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn9"><p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Article 1 of the law of August 18, 1836, repressing attacks on the nation’s credit, states: “Anyone who, by any means, knowingly spreads false facts or misleading allegations among the public, likely to directly or indirectly undermine confidence in the solidity of the currency, the value of State funds of any kind, funds of departments and communes, public institutions, and, in general, all organizations where the aforementioned communities have direct or indirect participation, shall be punished with two years’ imprisonment and a €9,000 fine.”</p></div></div></section>
<section id="linflation-des-prix" class="level2 unnumbered page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="linflation-des-prix">Price Inflation</h2>
<p>Seigniorage’s primary consequence is price inflation. Originating from the Latin <em>inflatio</em>, meaning “swelling” or “expansion,” inflation refers to the loss of money’s purchasing power, resulting in a general and sustained price increase. It’s a long-term phenomenon affecting the entire economy.</p>
<p>Contrary to common belief, not all price increases signify inflation. Due to its enduring nature, inflation is inherently structural rather than cyclical. Temporary State-imposed measures might raise prices but don’t constitute inflation per se.</p>
<p>Price inflation has been observed in numerous economies. It accompanied the Roman Empire’s decline from the 3rd century, peaking under Emperor Diocletian. Modern economies experienced it after both World Wars, during the 1970s, and more recently in the 2020s.</p>
<p>Inflation can stem from a general demand increase or a supply decrease of goods and services. Theoretically, several factors can cause it, such as monetary inflation, energy scarcity, war-induced wealth destruction, or capital flight. In practice, in a growing, peaceful, and independent economy, long-term price inflation generally results from monetary inflation.</p>
<p>Monetary inflation is the excessive production of money beyond what the free market would naturally generate<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. It arises from State manipulation of currency to profit through seigniorage. States often sacrifice long-term purchasing power for short-term revenue, especially during military, political, or health crises.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn10"><p><sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Defined by Guido Hülsmann as “the increase of the nominal quantity of a medium of exchange beyond what would have been produced on the free market.” — Jörg Guido Hülsmann, <em>The Ethics of Money Production</em>, p.&nbsp;85.</p></div><div id="fn11"><p><sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Richard Cantillon, <em>Essay on the Nature of Trade in General</em>, McMaster University Archive for the History of Economic Thought, 1755.</p></div></div><p>Inflation is often misunderstood because it’s not the uniform, instantaneous phenomenon many imagine. Injecting money into the economy has a progressive and varied impact on prices as it diffuses through transactions. This is known as the Cantillon Effect, observed in 1730 by economist Richard Cantillon in his <em>Essay on the Nature of Trade in General</em>, where he stated that “an increase of actual money [causes] in a State a proportionate increase of consumption, which [produces] by degrees an increase in prices<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.”</p>
<p>The Cantillon Effect applies across space and time. Newly produced money may concentrate in specific areas (like urban centers), regions (even outside national borders), or economic sectors (such as finance). Its spread can be delayed by practices like monthly salary payments. However, the increased money supply eventually impacts the entire economy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those closest to the money issuance benefit first. The issuer spends it, adding demand and potentially offering higher prices for desired goods. The merchant receiving it, now temporarily wealthier, spends more generously with another merchant. This cycle continues until it reaches the economy’s fringes, resulting in those farthest from the issuance being most adversely affected.</p>
<p>Thus, price inflation is a delayed manifestation of monetary inflation from excessive State seigniorage. If unchecked, it can ultimately destroy the unit of account, leading to hyperinflation. In such cases, inflation is driven less by money production (which struggles to keep pace) and more by capital flight to stronger currencies or liquid assets.</p>

<section id="les-banques-centrales" class="level2 unnumbered page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="les-banques-centrales">Central Banks</h2>
<p>Today’s global monetary system is founded on the central bank model. A central bank is an institution with a monopoly on issuing the legally recognized currency within a territory. Every country utilizes such an institution to manage its fiat currency.</p>
<p>Central banks emerged from State control over banking activities. Modern banking—trading money and credit—developed during the Renaissance, based on innovations like demand deposits and bills of exchange, which evolved into checking accounts and banknotes as credit became a monetary substitute.</p>
<p>Over time, authorities centralized banking by establishing public banks with advantages over private competitors. Initially confined to cities (like the Banco del Rialto in Venice, 1587, or Sweden’s Sveriges Riksbank in 1668), some evolved into national banks, such as the Bank of England (1694) and France’s Bank (1800).</p>
<p>Central banks gained prominence by securing note issuance monopolies. The Bank of England obtained this through the 1844 Bank Charter Act. Similar developments occurred elsewhere, like the Royal Bank of Prussia in 1846 and the Bank of France’s nationwide issuance privilege in 1848. The United States established its central bank, the Federal Reserve, in 1913.</p>
<p>Despite claims of independence, central banks aren’t separate from the State. They rely on State enforcement for their monopolies and legal tender status, while the State depends on them for seigniorage revenue. Thus, central banks are integral to the State apparatus.</p>
<p>This centralization led to the enduring establishment of fiat paper money. Initially backed by precious metals (like gold during the 1873–1914 classical gold standard), direct convertibility was gradually suspended—temporarily during wars and then permanently from World War I onwards. In 1971, any gold reference was abandoned when President Nixon ended the Bretton Woods system.</p>
<p>Central banks now play a dominant role, heavily influencing economies through monetary policy. Their primary missions include limiting price inflation (often targeting a 2% annual CPI increase) and acting as lenders of last resort<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, providing liquidity during credit crunches. Secondary goals might include reducing unemployment.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn12"><p><sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The central bank’s role as lender of last resort was theorized in the 19th century—Henry Thornton, <em>An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain</em>, 1802; Walter Bagehot, <em>Lombard Street</em>, 1873.</p></div></div><p>To achieve these aims, central banks typically utilize three tools: producing physical money, purchasing securities on financial markets, and influencing credit issuance via key interest rates. They may produce physical currency or delegate this task (e.g., the ECB delegates to national banks).</p>
<p>They engage in open market operations, buying and selling securities (like government bonds) on the interbank market. Unconventional policies, such as quantitative easing, provide liquidity during crises but primarily finance State debt—expanding balance sheets indicate seigniorage.</p>
<p>Key interest rates influence bank credit issuance. These rates include the refinancing rate (standard rate for banks obtaining central money), marginal lending rate (short-term emergency funds), and deposit facility rate (interest on reserves held at the central bank). These rates, set by the central bank, can even be negative, affecting lending and borrowing behaviors.</p>
<p>Through these mechanisms, central banks—and thus the State—extract seigniorage by lending central money to commercial banks, which then lend to borrowers, dispersing funds throughout the economy via investment and consumption.</p>
<p>In this hierarchical system, commercial banks also profit from their position. Forming a cartel, they enjoy credit issuance privileges and protection from economic fallout via central bank support and potential Treasury bailouts<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. This encourages credit expansion, fueling economic booms and busts, leading to malinvestment and recessions.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn13"><p><sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Commercial bank customers are encouraged to keep funds in banks by partial protection against bank failure through deposit guarantee schemes, like France’s FGDR or the U.S.’s FDIC.</p></div></div><p>Criticism of this banking system grew after the 1971 abandonment of Bretton Woods. Satoshi Nakamoto joined this critique in February 2009, highlighting the system’s flaws to promote Bitcoin:</p>
<p>“The fundamental problem with conventional currency is all the trust required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn14"><p><sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Satoshi Nakamoto, <em>Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency</em>, February 11, 2009: <a href="https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source" class="uri">https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source</a>.</p></div></div><p>Thus, central banks result from banking centralization. They’re no longer banks issuing substitutes but are now currency creators, replacing mints that once struck coins.</p>
<p>Notably, the control over banknotes and their eventual detachment from precious metals led to fiat money’s establishment. Similarly, controlling bank accounts is ongoing. With the State’s deposit guarantees and the digitization of bank credit, conditions are ripe for another shift—central bank digital currencies.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="la-monnaie-numérique-de-banque-centrale">Central Bank Digital Currency</h2>
<p>A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a digital fiat currency issued by a central bank. It’s entirely digital and doesn’t represent a claim on assets. CBDC systems are currently being designed worldwide, potentially marking a significant evolution in monetary history by indirectly nationalizing bank deposits.</p>
<p>The idea of a central bank managing a digital currency competing with commercial bank money isn’t new, predating widespread Internet use. Economist James Tobin suggested in 1987:</p>
<p>“I believe the government should make available to the public a medium of exchange offering the convenience of deposits and the safety of currency, essentially currency in the form of deposits, transferable in any amount by check or other order<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn15"><p><sup>15</sup>&nbsp;James Tobin, “The Case for Preserving Regulatory Distinctions,” in <em>Proceedings—Economic Policy Symposium—Jackson Hole</em>, 1987, pp.&nbsp;167–205.</p></div><div id="fn16"><p><sup>16</sup>&nbsp;peculium, <em>Fedcoin: A centrally-issued alternative to peer-to-peer currencies</em>, March 26, 2013.</p></div><div id="fn17"><p><sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Jean-Luc (Bitcoin.fr), <em>Birth of Eurocoin</em>, April 1, 2014.</p></div><div id="fn18"><p><sup>18</sup>&nbsp;David Andolfatto, <em>Fedcoin: On the Desirability of a Government Cryptocurrency</em>, February 3, 2015.</p></div></div><p>Bitcoin’s emergence reignited interest in such a currency.

<p>The term “central bank digital currency” gained prominence after Ben Broadbent’s 2016 speech<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, discussing how distributed ledgers could revolutionize interbank settlements and allow individuals to hold central bank accounts, competing with cash and bank deposits.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn19"><p><sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Ben Broadbent, <em>Central banks and digital currencies</em>, March 2, 2016.</p></div><div id="fn20"><p><sup>20</sup>&nbsp;James Lovejoy et al., <em>A High Performance Payment Processing System Designed for Central Bank Digital Currencies</em>, February 3, 2022.</p></div></div><p>Since then, experimental implementations have emerged. China’s People’s Bank began deploying its digital yuan in 2020. Sweden’s Riksbank started testing the e-Krona in 2016. In the U.S., the MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative partnered with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on Project Hamilton, a CBDC prototype<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Technically, a CBDC would use a distributed ledger across several servers, employing consensus mechanisms suited for high transaction volumes. Financial data replication enhances resilience against failures or cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Access would require user identification, likely through digital identity systems, aligning with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism regulations. Transactions would be private from the public but observable by authorized entities.</p>
<p>Programmable features could allow conditional spending, and the system could evolve to include new functionalities.</p>
<p>For users, CBDCs offer multiple benefits: eliminating credit counterparty risk, enhancing accessibility and financial inclusion by “banking the unbanked,” and automating financial operations to improve online services.</p>
<p>While CBDCs seem to modernize outdated physical money, they present significant potential for increased State control and disadvantages for individuals.</p>
<p>For the State, CBDCs offer total financial control. They could legally eliminate cash, as CBDCs would constitute base money with easily defined legal tender. This leads to the gradual disappearance of physical money.</p>
<p>Enhanced financial surveillance becomes feasible, with automated processing via artificial intelligence. Tax collection could be streamlined through direct account debits, as discussed in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="la-resistance-a-la-censure.html" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ch:censure">9</a> on censorship resistance.</p>
<p>Additionally, CBDCs have inflationary potential. Replacing cash reduces production and distribution costs, improving seigniorage on base money. Gradually supplanting bank credit allows the State to reclaim seigniorage from commercial banks, possibly diminishing or eliminating their lending capacity. Banks might then serve as intermediaries within the system.</p>
<p>Commercial banks could be absorbed into the central bank, fulfilling the Marxist vision of centralized credit<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>. Like the Gosbank in the Soviet Union, this singular bank would follow central directives, issuing loans financed by monetary creation to favored entities.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn21"><p><sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Point 5 of the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> advocates “centralization of credit in the hands of the State through a national bank with State capital and exclusive monopoly.” — Karl Marx, <em>Manifesto of the Communist Party</em>, 1895.</p></div></div><p>Though this seems unlikely, the dangers of such a system might not deter its adoption. Public acceptance is challenging but not impossible. Incentives might encourage CBDC use, while penalties discourage refusal. Rewards could include subsidies for merchants and consumers (as seen with China’s digital yuan), while punishments might involve imposing legal tender laws, denying access to public services without a central bank account, and censoring anti-CBDC opinions as conspiratorial.</p>
<p>Ultimately, CBDC adoption hinges on public acceptance. While resistance exists, the State may prevail over time, as it did with paper money. In that scenario, Bitcoin could remain the only viable monetary alternative for dissenters.</p>

<section id="larbitrage-juridictionnel" class="level2 unnumbered page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="larbitrage-juridictionnel">Jurisdictional Arbitrage</h2>
<p>A common strategy to safeguard individual freedom against State control is “jurisdictional arbitrage.” This involves exploiting differences between jurisdictions to optimize living conditions—for example, emigrating to benefit from lower taxes. Such actions might pressure States to respect citizens’ freedoms through competition, effectively a form of “voting with one’s feet.”</p>
<p>Jurisdictional arbitrage emerged as migration costs dropped due to relaxed movement restrictions, reduced travel expenses, and increased asset liquidity. The Internet further amplified this by allowing individuals to partially escape local authorities’ influence.</p>
<p>Authors Rees-Mogg and Davidson discussed this in <em>The Sovereign Individual</em> (1997), predicting Nation-States’ decline due to technological innovation. They proposed an “inequivalence theorem” opposing Ricardian equivalence, suggesting that rational individuals would relocate rather than save more in response to increased taxes:</p>
<p>“In the Information Age, […] rational individuals will respond to prospective tax increases for deficit financing by moving residence or conducting transactions elsewhere. […] Sovereign Individuals and other rational actors can be expected to flee jurisdictions with large unfunded obligations<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn22"><p><sup>22</sup>&nbsp;William Rees-Mogg, James Dale Davidson, <em>The Sovereign Individual</em>, Touchstone, 1999, p.&nbsp;247.</p></div><div id="fn23"><p><sup>23</sup>&nbsp;John Perry Barlow, <em>A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</em>, February 8, 1996.</p></div></div><p>Cypherpunks shared this view, seeing cyberspace as an independent jurisdiction beyond State reach<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>. They envisioned a cybercurrency outside State control. Eric Hughes noted in 1994:</p>
<p>“The biggest question is: How big can monetary flows on the networks grow before the State demands reporting every transaction? If flows become large enough, a transnational service might be economically incentivized to issue a currency, rendering State actions irrelevant<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn24"><p><sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Kevin Kelly, “E-Money,” in <em>Out of Control</em>, Addison-Wesley, 1994.</p></div><div id="fn25"><p><sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Parker Lewis, <em>Bitcoin Cannot be Banned</em>, August 11, 2019.</p></div></div><p>Widespread jurisdictional arbitrage could naturally lead to sound money’s emergence. If States compete and individuals move freely, people might favor less-taxed currencies, like gold-based or Bitcoin-based ones, prompting States to adopt better currencies to attract prosperity<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, this appealing theory overlooks the power dynamics between States. States aren’t independent; they compete to extract resources from populations, primarily through territorial control—a conflict that can escalate to war. Decreasing a State’s tax revenue might invite imperialistic interference from dominant powers. Therefore, inter-State competition is less economic and more political, involving sanctions restricting economic and migratory flows.</p>
<p>Monetary imperialism—favoring one’s currency abroad through force or its threat—is a facet of this, seeking additional seigniorage from wider currency use<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>.

Jurisdictional arbitrage applies only marginally, as long as it doesn’t significantly weaken central authority. Meaningful monetary change relies on individual disobedience in the medium term.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="les-monnaies-alternatives-centralisées">Centralized Alternative Currencies</h2>
<p>In response to enforced monetary systems, some individuals have attempted to create alternatives—not local currencies with limited goals, but those aiming to counterbalance State currencies. The U.S. offers notable examples due to its tradition of private currencies and individual freedom.</p>
<p>During the colonial period and early 19th century, private coinage and relatively free banking were common. However, post–Civil War measures ended this freedom. The 1864 Congressional Act prohibited private coinage<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>, and the National Banking Acts centralized banking.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn27"><p><sup>27</sup>&nbsp;The 1864 law became <em>18 U.S. Code § 486</em>, prohibiting private coinage.</p></div></div><p>The Secret Service was established in 1865 to combat counterfeiting and financial fraud, indirectly reinforcing monetary monopolies. This centralization culminated with the Federal Reserve’s creation in 1913 and the 1933 gold possession ban.</p>
<p>After abandoning gold references and with the Internet’s rise, private currency ideas resurfaced. Individuals, inspired by Hayekian principles, sought to introduce their own currencies. Notable projects include ALH&amp;Co, the Liberty Dollar, e-gold, and Liberty Reserve.</p>
<p>ALH&amp;Co, founded by Anthony L. Hargis, offered gold- or dollar-denominated accounts<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. Despite efforts to remain legal, it facilitated tax evasion and was ultimately shut down in 2004 after legal action.</p>

<p>E-gold, founded in 1996 by Douglas Jackson and Barry Downey, was a digital gold currency. At its peak, it held 3.6 tons of gold and managed millions of accounts.

Jackson, <em>The PayPal Wars</em>, 2012.</p></div></div><p>Monetary monopolies are subtly enforced through counterfeiting and money laundering laws, leaving no legal alternatives.

<p>State intervention aims to control monetary systems, destroying alternatives if necessary. Bitcoin was designed to resist this formidable force.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="bitcoin-contre-létat">Bitcoin Against the State</h2>
<p>The State embodies organized, territorial, and institutionalized non-consensual wealth transfer. Consequently, it claims control over money as its prerogative, especially since it derives income (seigniorage) from it. Over time, this control has become increasingly insidious, accelerating with banking’s rise during the Renaissance. Banknotes were co-opted by central banks, which monopolized their production, transforming them into fiat money. Similarly, bank deposits, now meticulously monitored, might soon be absorbed by central bank digital currencies.</p>
<p>Believing the State will relinquish its extraction methods or make them more transparent is unrealistic unless beneficiaries demand change. Smaller States might seem capable of reform, but dominant powers’ imperialistic ambitions hinder this. Running a server in a favorable jurisdiction isn’t sufficient for managing a digital currency, as Liberty Reserve’s case illustrates.</p>
<p>Thus, Bitcoin is designed to resist State intervention, attempting to build a robust alternative to current monetary systems. It achieves this by distributing operations across a peer-to-peer network of nodes. This equal distribution shares risks among participants, ensuring the system’s security relies on their combined economic actions rather than a single entity.</p>
