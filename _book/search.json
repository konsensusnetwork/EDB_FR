    "text": "Ludovic Lars is widely regarded as one of the foremost French-speaking “scholars” on Bitcoin. This term, which surfaced in several conversations about his publishing project, inspired the theme of this preface.\nWhen he honored me by requesting this preface, he cautioned that the “liberal” tone of his Elegance of Bitcoin might contrast with my own sensibilities. Yet, I perceived in it a kind of moral elegance. Indeed, the author has read both the so-called “Austrian” economists and Proudhon, and he is no more a stubborn or toxic maximalist than I am. As someone who opposes ideological extremisms and one-dimensional reasoning, I cannot be offended that within a community advocating for decentralized solutions, differing opinions prevail, along with their inherent visions and biases.\nEmbracing what one might once have called a true “Benedictine labor,” the author sought and gained the trust of numerous specialists who ensured that his work incorporated a broad spectrum of knowledge and received meticulous review. Beyond this collaboration of experts, there was a genuine communal, financial, and moral commitment to bring this book to publication.\nThus, we encounter here a work that, through its seldom polemical tone, profound erudition, and integration into a collective movement, participates in the tradition of the French Encyclopedia. It is known that the promoters of the Britannica accused Diderot and d’Alembert’s encyclopedia of “spreading anarchy,” and it cannot be denied that, composed during the blossoming of the Enlightenment, this compendium of all kinds of knowledge—both theoretical and practical—courageously took sides in the political and philosophical struggles of its time, explicitly intending to foster critical reflection and “change the common way of thinking.” Perhaps the same can be said here: Bitcoin and this book invite you not merely, or not only, to change currency but to change thought.\nPerceiving this connection, I delved into the Encyclopedia. The article on “Erudition,” penned by d’Alembert himself, states that it “encompasses three principal branches: the knowledge of History, of Languages, and of Books.” By perhaps substituting languages with protocols, he might also have appreciated—and prefaced better than I—the book you are about to open.\nMy own mind, shaped by historical studies, reveled in the initial chapters, which form veritable Annals of Bitcoin. Historians of today and the future will surely value the extensive reliable information and compiled references. As a mathematician by training, the author first produced a substantial archival work, evidenced by nearly a thousand scholarly footnotes.\nAs the creator of Bitcoin.fr wrote to me, “He uncovers and deciphers obscure debates that nonetheless played a crucial role in the evolution of the protocol, making them understandable to all.” Therefore, while his presentation of monetary history might be critiqued or reframed in light of his personal convictions, his construction of Bitcoin’s history is a contribution from which others will beneficially draw.\nBeyond History, there are the Languages and the Books: references, code, game theory, and mathematics. There is much to harvest in these pages—many austere subjects, but also delightful anecdotes. While the book details the inevitable story of the famous pizza, it also reminds us that a Bitcoin faucet operated for two years, dispensing 5 bitcoins upon each request, or that the individual who discovered the first flaw graciously informed Satoshi instead of exploiting his discovery to cheat. It highlights that before its phase of “conflictual growth,” the early years of the venture saw “organic and cautious growth, protected from the opportunism and propaganda of our world,” and that the community has exhibited, from the very beginning, extraordinary resilience—something worthy of contemplation.\nThe wealth of quotations does justice to the cypherpunks, sometimes depicted as sinister figures fomenting a tax revolt over an ill-timed barbecue. It restores the historical and intellectual depth of what was a collective grassroots movement, not a superficial sectarian reaction. Furthermore, the meticulously retraced individual paths demonstrate that Austrian influence, though significant, was neither universal nor absolute. Many cryptographers, cypherpunks or otherwise, did not embrace it as a revealed dogma or a scientifically established truth.\nLudovic Lars also underscores this crucial point: the cypherpunks were not alone in trying to construct distributed systems capable of facilitating monetary exchange—because there was a genuine problem and a genuine need. Amid the intellectual ferment, exchanges were plentiful; it is amusing to recall that Ripple was also inspired by the localism of LETS schemes! In fact, what sets Bitcoin apart from all other attempts is that it—the first not to rely on trust in the classical sense—succeeded as a currency because it managed to build an elective, philosophical, and political community. Bitcoin is the largest community currency of all time.\nThus, delving into its long saga both before and after 2009 is not merely a historian’s whim. Beyond gaining essential insight into its roots, the intentions, and ambitions that motivated its precursors and those who witnessed its birth, one finds ample material to debunk many persistent intellectual deceits. No, central bank digital currencies or algorithmic stablecoins do not represent refinements of Bitcoin, nor do they promise improvements to our future existence.\nThe various altcoins—somewhat community-driven, often entrepreneurial or even banking—are extensively cited, primarily to illustrate the discussion, enrich it with examples, and highlight dead ends or objections. Never, it bears repeating, and even though the author is well acquainted with them, is the aim to “surpass” or “perfect” Bitcoin, whose organic development and refinement is the concern of bitcoiners.\nThe author is a technical expert, yet he also knows how to write. All that is technical (and overlooked by many people, even those who present themselves as “experts”)—everything that d’Alembert would term “the Languages”—is dissected in this work with an extremely meticulous scalpel and rendered in the language where what is well conceived “is stated clearly.” This deserves to be given to the next politician, financier, economist, or commentator who claims that “it rests on nothing”!\nThe title of the book is also that of a pleasantly balanced conclusion between those who see Bitcoin as the panacea and those who view it solely negatively. It may surprise some fervent and naïve adherents, but it remains in the spirit of d’Alembert: “In criticism, there are two extremes to equally avoid, too much indulgence and too much severity.”\nCuriously, the author dwells little on the word elegance itself, which his mathematical background perhaps leads him to perceive as encompassing truth, beauty, and rigor. Like Aristotle, he may have contemplated order, precision, and the ability to harmonize multiple concepts, adjusting them effectively together—a feat that Satoshi Nakamoto achieved at the highest level.\nTo address the reader at the threshold of this useful, dense, and distinguished book, I once again give the floor to d’Alembert, who opined that “the assistance we have today for erudition facilitates it so much that our laziness would be inexcusable if we did not take advantage of it.”\n\nJacques Favier, November 21, 2023",

    "text": "Since its inception in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has sparked extensive discussion. Over the years, it has ignited intense passions and been the subject of numerous heated debates. Thousands of articles have been written, hundreds of videos produced, and dozens of books published on the topic. The surge in its price has granted it extraordinary media visibility, embedding it into the global collective imagination.\nYet, Bitcoin remains widely misunderstood. Many speak of it with only a superficial grasp, failing to discern its true utility. Some believe it serves merely for speculation; others imagine it is used exclusively by criminals; and some even assert that it is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme. Conversely, a number of individuals harbor unrealistic expectations, thinking it could become the world’s reserve currency or even replace all monetary exchanges in the economy within a few years. Immersed in this delusion, they cling to the hope that its price will reach astronomical levels, continuing the speculative rises of the past. However, few attempt to adopt a realistic and sober perspective that balances the dreamers’ vision—who see Bitcoin as the solution to all the world’s problems—with the disingenuous detractors who consider Bitcoin a scourge to be halted at all costs.\nI first learned about Bitcoin in April 2013, following the Cypriot financial crisis. Initially quite skeptical, I nonetheless took an interest in the system, as it was highlighted by the French liberals and American libertarians I followed. On July 9, 2015, I decided to give it a try: I acquired €50 worth of bitcoins (0.2 BTC) from the Swiss exchange platform Fastcoin (now known as Bity), which I received in my newly created Electrum wallet. That day, I made my first transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. These few fractions of bitcoin allowed me to make donations: first to the blogger H16, then to activist Adam Kokesh, followed by the DarkWallet project by Amir Taaki and Cody Wilson, and finally to the Sci-Hub platform managed by Alexandra Elbakyan.\nMy real involvement with Bitcoin began in the spring of 2017, when the price started to rise again after years of stagnation. Until then, I had merely followed the cryptocurrency from a distance, and this increase piqued my interest. It was at that moment that I fully immersed myself in this world. I read extensively on the subject, acquiring works such as Bitcoin, la monnaie acéphale by Adli Takkal-Bataille and Jacques Favier, Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos, and Digital Gold by Nathaniel Popper. I also began speculating on a modest scale by purchasing bitcoin and various alternative cryptocurrencies.\nSimultaneously, I started writing on the topic, eventually becoming a contributor for specialized sites like Cryptoast and Journal du Coin. Over the years, I have written more than 150 in-depth articles on various subjects related to cryptocurrency, whether from a technical, economic, or political perspective. My understanding of Bitcoin matured accordingly, to the point where I could claim to “understand Bitcoin,” even if my conception remained, of course, partial and influenced by my own perspective.\nHowever, this was not necessarily the case among those around me, who had only a superficial idea and likely lacked the time to delve deeper. This motivated me to write this book. In particular, since the monetary protocol depends on the economic actions of its users, it seemed important to share the genuine knowledge that emerged from my research and experience. Moreover, with the progression of banking censorship, the development of central bank digital currencies, the war on cash, and the return of inflation, I believe it is more essential than ever to fully grasp this tool to use it effectively in the future.\nThis work aims to present Bitcoin in a clear and comprehensive manner, adopting multiple viewpoints. It narrates the long journey that led to its creation, as well as its brief but dense history from its origins to the present day. It describes its essentially economic functioning stemming from its monetary nature. It addresses the political issues Bitcoin responds to, particularly the problem of censorship. Finally, it examines its technical mechanisms in detailed and precise terms. By reading this book, you may perhaps, like me, come to see Bitcoin as a harmonious whole, whose foundational model possesses a rare elegance.\nI hope you will appreciate this modest contribution to something that transcends us all: the project of an alternative, free, and resilient currency, offering ordinary individuals the ability to resist the powers of this world. Vires in numeris.\n\nLudovic Lars, December 1, 2023",

    "text": "A Difficult Birth\nBitcoin was conceived by an individual using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who claimed to be a 33-year-old Japanese man1. Little is known about him beyond his public messages and the computer code he published. Satoshi disappeared in 2011, and it is unknown whether he is still alive.\nAccording to his own account, Satoshi Nakamoto began working on Bitcoin in the spring of 2007. For more than a year, he kept his model secret, wanting to ensure it worked correctly before presenting it to the world. He would later claim to have coded the prototype before writing the paper2.\nIn August 2008, Satoshi finished drafting the white paper and began preparing to announce Bitcoin’s release. On August 18, he registered the domain name Bitcoin.org via the anonymous service AnonymousSpeech3. The domain would be used to host Bitcoin’s main website.\nA few days later, he contacted Adam Back, the British cryptographer and cypherpunk behind Hashcash, the technique used in Bitcoin to compute the proof of work. Adam Back referred him to the cryptographer Wei Dai, the inventor of the b-money concept in 1998—a concept with notable similarities to Bitcoin. On August 22, Satoshi emailed Wei Dai to tell him he was “getting ready to release a paper that expands on [his] ideas into a fully working system” and to ask him “the publication year of [his] b-money page” to reference it in the white paper4. However, despite these interactions, Adam Back and Wei Dai did not immediately take interest in Bitcoin. It would be years later before they revisited this revolutionary discovery by the mysterious figure.\nIn the fall of 2008, Satoshi decided to make his system public. On October 5, he registered on the project management platform SourceForge, where Bitcoin’s open-source code would be hosted and maintained until 2011. On October 31, he published the white paper on a cryptography mailing list. This list, the Metzdowd Cryptography Mailing List managed by Perry Metzger on his website Metzdowd.com, included participation from several former cypherpunks5. In his introductory email, he wrote:\n“I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party6.”\nThe white paper centered on the problem of online payments, and the goal of Bitcoin was clearly stated from the outset:\n“Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model. […] What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party7.”\nFrom a technical standpoint, it involved establishing a distributed ledger of transactions over an open peer-to-peer network of computers. This ledger was composed of blocks of transactions linked sequentially over time, forming a “chain of blocks.” Bitcoin thus constituted a “distributed timestamp server,” recording the order of transactions to create a coherent history without “double spending.” This allowed for the management of the issuance and exchange of a digital unit of account, which would be called bitcoin.\nThe system’s reliability rested on “proofs of work” that linked the blocks together, making it difficult to alter the chain. These proofs were periodically produced by network members who provided energy for this purpose and were rewarded with an “incentive” in bitcoins, consisting of newly created units and transaction fees. Those who expended their electrical energy were compared by Satoshi to “gold miners who expend resources to add gold to circulation,” hence the term miners that they would later adopt.\nFollowing Bitcoin’s announcement and the publication of the white paper, Satoshi received few responses, many of them skeptical. First, cypherpunk James A. Donald questioned the system’s scalability, saying that “it does not seem to scale to the required size8.” Then, John Levine criticized its security, mentioning the computing power held by “farms of zombie machines9,” composed of computers controlled by hackers. Finally, a third individual named Ray Dillinger questioned the value of the unit of account, lamenting that “computational proofs of work have no intrinsic value10.”\nHowever, this skeptical reception was not shared by everyone on the mailing list. Notably, Hal Finney, an American computer scientist and cryptographer in his fifties, was decidedly enthusiastic. In his message on November 7, he wrote that “Bitcoin seems to be a very promising idea11.” Hal Finney was no ordinary person: a founding member of the cypherpunk movement, he had participated in developing the encryption software PGP in the 1990s alongside Philip Zimmermann, experimented with early electronic money systems, and even attempted to create his own system of reusable proofs of work. Despite his experience, he remained optimistic and thus became the very first supporter of Satoshi’s project. Years later, he would state that “aged cryptographers […] tend to become cynical,” but he “was more idealistic,” having “always loved cryptography, its mystery and paradox12.”\nSubsequently, Satoshi distributed the main code files to interested individuals, including Hal Finney, Ray Dillinger, and James A. Donald13. Hal and Ray conducted a thorough review of the code, each focusing on a specific part of the system. This code already included all the fundamental components of Bitcoin. The prototype was then ready to be launched.",

    "section": "A Timid Childhood",
    "text": "A Timid Childhood\nTwo months after the publication of the white paper, on January 8, 2009, at 7:27 PM, Satoshi Nakamoto shared the first version of the software on the Metzdowd mailing list. The source code in C++ was openly published under a free license (MIT), allowing anyone to copy, modify, and use the software at will. It contained the data of the genesis block, the first block of the chain from which it would extend.\nA few hours later, Satoshi began mining. The second block of the chain, block 1, was validated by Satoshi on January 9 at 2:54 AM, marking the official launch of the network.\nOn January 10, Hal tried to run the software. After communicating with Satoshi to get it working, he began mining and found his first block (block 78) at 1 AM (UTC), earning 50 bitcoins. Two and a half hours later, he shared his experience on Twitter (a nascent social media platform) by writing “Running bitcoin14.” The next day, during the night of January 11–12, Satoshi sent 10 bitcoins to Hal via his IP address—the first transfer from one person to another on the network15.\n14 Hal Finney on Twitter, 01/11/2009 3:33 UTC: https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988.15 This first transaction between Satoshi and Hal had the identifier f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16 and was confirmed in block 170 on January 12 at 3:30.16 The identifier of the transaction received by Dustin (via P2IP) was d71fd2f64c0b34465b7518d240c00e83f6a5b10138a7079d1252858fe7e6b577.Hal was not the only person experimenting on the network at that time. Dustin Trammell, an American computer security researcher who had discovered Bitcoin through the mailing list, was also involved. He communicated with Satoshi via email and received 25 bitcoins from him on January 1516.\nBut the few people running the software were not enough. From the outset, Satoshi knew that few had seriously examined his model and that attracting new users and contributors would be challenging. He therefore tried to generate enthusiasm by promoting his idea as effectively as possible.\nThe first element was the bitcoin issuance schedule, capped at 21 million units. In the email announcing the prototype, Satoshi outlined the monetary creation rate:\n“The total number of coins in circulation will be 21,000,000. They will be distributed to network nodes when they create blocks, with the amount released halving every 4 years. […] Once that sum is exhausted, the system can support transaction fees if needed17.”\n17 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin v0.1 released, 01/08/2009 19:27:40 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.html.18 Hal Finney, Re: Bitcoin v0.1 released, 01/11/2009 02:22:01 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html.Bitcoin was thus intended to become a currency with a fixed supply, inherently deflationary—a characteristic that generated excitement. On January 11, Hal Finney was the first to respond, expressing delight that “the system can be configured to allow only a certain maximum number of coins to be generated.” He estimated that if “Bitcoin [is] successful and [becomes] the dominant payment system used worldwide,” each coin would then be “worth about ten million dollars18.” While the estimate is debatable, the reasoning remains pertinent given how Bitcoin functions.\nOn January 16, Satoshi reiterated this message in an email shared with the mailing list, stating that it “might make sense to get some [coins] just in case it catches on” and that “if enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy19.” This point is crucial, as evidenced by Dustin Trammell’s testimony, who told Satoshi that Hal’s reasoning was “one of the reasons why [he] spun up a node so quickly.”\n19 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin v0.1 released, 01/16/2009 16:03:14 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015014.html.Beyond the issuance schedule, Satoshi chose to highlight flaws in the banking system—a second strategy to attract attention.\nHe did this from the very first block, the genesis block, by including the headline from the British daily The Times of January 3, 2009, announcing that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was on the brink of a second bailout for banks:\n“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”\nThis phrase in the first block serves a dual purpose: it prevents backdating by proving that the system wasn’t launched before January 3 (since Satoshi couldn’t have known the headline before that date), and it symbolically indicates what Bitcoin opposes by referencing the monetary and financial context of the time.\nIn January 2009, the world was reeling from the effects of the financial crisis that began in 2007 with the bursting of the housing bubble in the United States, known as the subprime mortgage crisis. Governments were bailing out banks to prevent further failures after the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, and central banks were engaging in quantitative easing by injecting liquidity into financial markets. This use of public funds, essentially created for the occasion, deeply shocked many citizens who realized that the banking system was, in effect, one of private profits and socialized losses.\nDue to its lack of trusted third parties, Bitcoin wasn’t subject to the whims of a central bank. It contrasted with state currencies like the dollar or the euro, whose supply could be arbitrarily modified by those controlling monetary creation through what’s known as monetary policy. Bitcoin’s monetary policy was programmed—hard-coded into the protocol—to theoretically never be altered.\nSatoshi highlighted this when he posted on the forum of the P2P Foundation, an organization studying the impact of peer-to-peer infrastructures on society, on February 11, 2009. In his introductory message about Bitcoin, he wrote:\n“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve20.”\n20 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency, February 11, 2009: https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source.On his profile, where he indicated being a 33-year-old man living in Japan, he provided a particular date of birth: April 5, 1975. This date, likely fictitious and composite, probably refers to the prohibition on individual ownership of gold in the United States. April 5 corresponds to the day Executive Order 6102 was signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt on April 5, 1933, instituting the ban, and the year 1975 marks its repeal with the enactment of Public Law 93-373. This detail isn’t trivial, as the prohibition ultimately led to the establishment of a floating monetary regime with no link to gold.\nThis isn’t the only reference to precious metals. On February 18, Satoshi wrote in his comments:\n“There is […] no one to act as a central bank or Federal Reserve to adjust the money supply as the number of users grows. […] In that sense, it’s more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply varying to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. This might create a positive feedback loop: more users drive higher value, which could attract more users seeking to benefit from the increasing value21.”\n21 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency, February 18, 2009: https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A9562.22 Mike Hearn, Questions about BitCoin, 04/11/2009 22:46 UTC: https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html.This communication strategy gradually bore fruit. Even though some people eventually turned away from Bitcoin, like Hal Finney, Satoshi continued to receive messages from interested individuals. On April 11, 2009, Mike Hearn, a British developer working for Google and dabbling in open-source software in his spare time, emailed him with a series of questions about Bitcoin, noting that “it’s rare to encounter truly revolutionary ideas22.” Hearn was interested in digital currencies at the time, including Ripple.\nIn early May 2009, a young Finnish computer science student contacted Satoshi: Martti Malmi. He had discovered Bitcoin in early April, started mining, and even wrote a brief description of Bitcoin on the Freedomain Radio forum, where he supported the anarchist notion that peer-to-peer money could make the state obsolete23. In his email to Satoshi, he wrote:\n23 Martti Malmi (Trickster), P2P Currency could make the government extinct?, 04/09/2009 17:49:47 UTC, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20150927195115/https://board.freedomainradio.com/topic/17233-p2p-currency-could-make-the-government-extinct/.24 Cited by Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin, 05/02/2009 17:06:58 UTC: https://mmalmi.github.io/satoshi/#email-1. (Note from January 2025.)“I’d like to help with Bitcoin if there’s anything I can do. I have good knowledge of Java and C from school courses (I’m studying computer science), but I don’t have much experience in development yet24.”\nDespite his lack of experience, Martti became the main contributor to Bitcoin after Satoshi in the following months. Being a student, he had ample time to devote to the project.\nIn particular, Satoshi entrusted him with managing the website. As early as May, Martti Malmi drafted an initial description on SourceForge, presenting Bitcoin as an “anonymous digital currency based on a peer-to-peer network” that allows “easy money transfer over the internet without having to trust third parties” and is “safe from instability caused by fractional reserve systems and poor central bank policies25.” This draft served as the basis for the presentation of Bitcoin on the website.\n25 Archived Bitcoin web page: https://web.archive.org/web/20090511173000/http://bitcoin.sourceforge.net/.At the time, bitcoin had no price. People testing the system simply ran the software to “generate coins.” Transactions were scarce and often involved self-transfers. Bitcoins were seen as collectibles reserved for computer enthusiasts. Users felt they were contributing to something, akin to distributed computing projects (known as “@home”) where people share their computing resources for good causes.\nSome individuals mined continuously. This included Hal Finney, who ran the software between January and March; James Howells, who validated blocks between February and April; Dustin Trammell, who kept his servers running for over a year; and Martti Malmi, who began using his laptop from April onward. But the main miner in 2009 was Satoshi, who deployed significantly more computing power, accounting for nearly half of the network’s block production.\nIn 2009, the mining difficulty was set at 1, requiring all network nodes to perform approximately 4.3 billion calculations to mine a block—a substantial task for a processor. Consequently, production was slower than anticipated: between January 9, 2009, and January 9, 2010, only 33,802 blocks were found out of the expected 52,560, corresponding to an average time between blocks of 15 minutes and 30 seconds instead of the planned 10 minutes. August 2009 was particularly slow, with only 1,564 out of 4,464 expected blocks found, averaging 28 minutes and 30 seconds per block!",

    "text": "Uncertain First Steps\nDespite its modest launch, Bitcoin survived the summer and reached a crucial milestone in October: its unit of account acquired a price. An individual using the pseudonym NewLibertyStandard (NLS), new to the community, set up a service on his personal page allowing people to convert dollars into bitcoins and vice versa. To estimate the exchange rate, he based it on the energy cost required to obtain a bitcoin, considering the electricity cost at his location and his personal production rate. Daily prices were published on his site.\nOn October 12, 2009, the first sale of bitcoins for dollars took place between Martti Malmi and NewLibertyStandard: Martti sold 5,050 bitcoins to NLS for $5.02, deposited into his PayPal account—approximately $0.001 per bitcoin26. NLS conducted additional exchanges in the following months, serving as the sole gateway between the dollar and bitcoin.\n26 “I found the earliest known bitcoin transaction in USD in my email backups. I sold 5,050 BTC for $5.02 on 12-10-2009.”—Martti Malmi on Twitter, 01/15/2014: https://twitter.com/marttimalmi/status/423455561703624704. The transaction identifier was 7dff938918f07619abd38e4510890396b1cef4fbeca154fb7aafba8843295ea2.On November 22, the new forum, simply called the Bitcoin Forum, was launched, hosted on Bitcoin.org and managed by Martti Malmi. This forum became the central hub for Bitcoin discussions from that point. It would be renamed Bitcointalk in August 2011 and moved to a new address.\nOn December 16, 2009, Satoshi announced the release of version 0.2 of the software, for which Martti Malmi received significant credit, marking the end of the first phase of Bitcoin’s software development. The year ended on a high note when the mining difficulty finally increased, rising from 1 to 1.18 on December 30.\nAt the beginning of 2010, bitcoin was designated a “cryptocurrency” on the website. The prefix “crypto-” (from the ancient Greek κρυπτός, kruptós, meaning hidden or secret) had a dual significance: it referred to the cryptography on which Bitcoin relied and to confidentiality, as Bitcoin was then presented as an “anonymous digital currency.”\nThis new term confirmed Bitcoin’s central goal: to become a currency—an intermediary in exchanges. This required people to generate transactions (through commerce) and others to process these transactions (through mining). Naturally, the expansion of these two complementary aspects occurred at that time.\nThe first development was commercial growth, with NewLibertyStandard considered a pioneer. Not only was he the first merchant to accept bitcoin as payment via his exchange service, but he was also one of the original promoters of building this economy. In his first message on the forum on January 19, 2010, he wrote:\n“People have bought and sold bitcoins from me. Supply and demand, even if small, already exist, and that’s all it takes. Offering to trade bitcoins for another currency is ultimately no different from exchanging bitcoins for goods or services. Currencies are goods, and exchange is a service. […] You can buy all my dollars or bitcoins today, but there will always be more tomorrow and the day after. Everyone who buys or sells goods using bitcoins, including exchangers, advances the Bitcoin economy. Let everyone do their part. Buy or sell something in exchange for bitcoins!27”\n27 NewLibertyStandard, Re: New Exchange Service: “BTC 2 PSC”, 01/19/2010 08:06:15 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=15.msg111#msg111.28 Satoshi Nakamoto, New icon/logo, 02/24/2010 21:24:23 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.msg504#msg504.In the following months, additional exchange services emerged, such as BitcoinFX and Bitcoin Market. NLS proposed that bitcoin, like currencies traded on the forex market, adopt the ticker symbol BTC and the Thai baht symbol. The use of the BTC symbol quickly became standardized. The symbol—a capital B crossed by two vertical lines, unmistakably reminiscent of the dollar sign—was designed by Satoshi himself, inspired by NLS’s proposal, when he created Bitcoin’s first real logo28.\n\n\n\nBitcoin logo designed by Satoshi Nakamoto in February 2010.\n\n\nSellers of goods and services also appeared. Beyond his exchange service, NLS opened an online store offering stamps and stickers. Other services accepting bitcoin emerged, including the VoIP service Link2VoIP, web host Vekja.net, and domain name seller Privacy Shark. Additionally, the first poker game involving bitcoins was organized, marking the beginning of the strong relationship between gambling and cryptocurrency.\nIn April 2010, MyBitcoin was launched—a custodial web application allowing for easy and secure use of Bitcoin, especially on mobile devices. With it, users didn’t need to download the complete data to send and receive transactions or manage their bitcoins by backing up private keys. At the time, lightweight wallets didn’t exist, so even Satoshi considered it acceptable to use such applications, despite going against Bitcoin’s fundamental principle of disintermediation:\n“The only drawback is that you have to trust the site, but that’s not a problem for small amounts intended for micropayments and miscellaneous expenses29.”\n29 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Ummmm… where did my bitcoins go?, 05/18/2010 20:06:46 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=125.msg1149#msg1149.30 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: A few suggestions, 12/12/2009 17:52:44 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=12.msg54#msg54.The year 2010 also saw the rise of mining, manifested primarily by the emergence of GPU (graphics processing unit) mining. Until then, miners used their central processing units (CPUs) to extract new bitcoins. However, these processors proved inefficient for repetitive operations compared to graphics cards, which were much better suited for such tasks. Consequently, everyone knew this evolution was inevitable, including Satoshi, who declared in December 2009 that the community should “agree to delay the GPU arms race as long as possible for the good of the network30.”\nThis shift was initiated by Laszlo Hanyecz, a 28-year-old American developer of Hungarian origin who discovered Bitcoin in April. After buying bitcoins from NLS and experimenting with the transaction system, he programmed mining software in early May that leveraged graphics cards. This optimization allowed him to quickly take a significant role in block production. This caught the attention of Satoshi Nakamoto, who contacted him and asked him to slow down his operations to keep mining accessible to everyone:\n“One of the main attractions for new users is that anyone with a computer can generate free coins. When there are 5,000 users, this incentive may fade, but for now, it’s still true. GPUs would prematurely limit this incentive to those with high-end GPU hardware. It’s inevitable that GPU compute clusters will eventually dominate all generated coins, but I don’t want to hasten that day. […] I don’t want to come across as a socialist; I don’t care about wealth concentration, but for now, we gain more growth by giving this money to 100% of people rather than 20%31.”\n31 Satoshi Nakamoto, May 2010, remarks reported by Nathaniel Popper: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/36vnmr/heres_what_satoshi_wrote_to_the_man_responsible/.Laszlo reduced his mining pace but continued using his graphics card. With his method, he accumulated tens of thousands of bitcoins.\nHowever, this wasn’t entirely negative for the project, as he eventually reinvested his bitcoins into the economy in the most emblematic way: by purchasing something—with pizzas, specifically. On May 18, 2010, he posted the following offer on the forum:\n“I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas… maybe two large ones so I have some leftover for the next day. I like having leftover pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to me or order it for me from a delivery service, but my goal is to get food delivered in exchange for bitcoins that I don’t have to order or prepare myself. […] If you’re interested, let me know, and we can work out a deal32.”\n32 Laszlo Hanyecz, Pizza for bitcoins?, 05/18/2010 00:35:20 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1141#msg1141.33 The transaction identifier for the pizza exchange between Laszlo Hanyecz and Jeremy Sturdivant was a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d.After four days, the offer was accepted. On May 22, a young Californian named Jeremy Sturdivant agreed to the exchange via the IRC messaging service: he ordered two Papa John’s pizzas to be delivered to Laszlo in Jacksonville, Florida, and received 10,000 bitcoins in return33, worth about $44 on Bitcoin Market at the time. This completed the first purchase of a physical good with bitcoins! This symbolic event would be commemorated annually on this date as Bitcoin Pizza Day.\nAnother individual contributed to the project’s success. Toward the end of May, Gavin Andresen, a 44-year-old American developer, discovered Bitcoin through an article published in InfoWorld. Having recently returned from Australia and temporarily unemployed, he began working on his first project: a bitcoin faucet that gave bitcoins to anyone who requested them. On June 11, Gavin launched his service and presented it on the forum:\n“For my first programming project on Bitcoin, I decided to do something that seems really stupid: I created a website that gives away bitcoins. […] Why? Because I want the Bitcoin project to succeed, and I think it has a better chance if people can get a handful of coins to try it out34.”\n34 Gavin Andresen, Get 5 free bitcoins from freebitcoins.appspot.com, 06/11/2010 17:38:45 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=183.msg1488#msg1488.35 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Get 5 free bitcoins from freebitcoins.appspot.com, 06/18/2010 23:08:34 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=183.msg1620#msg1620.This faucet, initially offering 5 bitcoins per request, was approved by Satoshi, who had “planned to do exactly the same thing if someone else hadn’t done it35.” The service, popular among users, would distribute over 19,700 bitcoins until its closure two years later. Moreover, Gavin became involved in software development and corresponded extensively with Satoshi via email. He quickly became Satoshi’s right-hand man, earning his trust.\nDespite encouraging economic growth, network activity remained extremely limited. On June 30, on the Bitcoin mailing list, James A. Donald declared that “Bitcoin is somewhat dead” and that “the problem is that bitcoin needs an ecology of users to be useful36.” However, a few days later, an event would prove him wrong.\n36 James A. Donald, Re: [bitcoin-list] New User, 06/30/2010 22:29:16 UTC, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20131016002646/http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/bitcoin-list/?viewmonth=201006.",

    "section": "The Slashdot Effect",
    "text": "The Slashdot Effect\nOn July 11, 2010, following the release of version 0.3 of the software, a brief introduction to Bitcoin written by a user was published on Slashdot—a popular news site covering topics for tech enthusiasts like computing, video games, science, and the internet. The promotional pitch was:\n“What do you think of this disruptive technology? Bitcoin is a digital currency based on a peer-to-peer network, with no central bank and no transaction fees. Using a proof-of-work concept, nodes burn CPU cycles to search for coin blocks and broadcast their results to the network. Energy consumption analysis reveals that the market value of bitcoins already exceeds the value of the energy required to generate them, indicating healthy demand. The community is hopeful that the currency will remain beyond any government’s reach37.”\n37 Teppy, “Bitcoin Releases Version 0.3”, Slashdot, July 11, 2010: https://news.slashdot.org/story/10/07/11/1747245/Bitcoin-Releases-Version-03.This caused a massive influx of new visitors to the site and forum, along with an increase in users and miners on the network. The network held up despite the surge in activity. Consequently, the price of bitcoin experienced its first major rise, jumping from $0.008 to $0.08 in a week—a tenfold increase!\nAmong those who discovered Bitcoin through Slashdot was Jed McCaleb, a 35-year-old American entrepreneur and programmer known for co-founding and developing the peer-to-peer file-sharing software eDonkey2000 in the 2000s. Noting how cumbersome it was to obtain bitcoins in exchange for dollars, he decided to create a specialized marketplace. He repurposed one of his earlier projects from 2007: Magic The Gathering Online eXchange (MTGOX), a website for buying and selling cards from the online game Magic: The Gathering Online38. He reused the same domain name: mtgox.com.\n38 Gwern Branwen, 2014 Jed McCaleb MtGox interview, February 16, 2014: https://www.gwern.net/docs/bitcoin/2014-mccaleb.39 Jed McCaleb, Re: New Bitcoin Exchange, 07/18/2010 02:53:07 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=444.msg3891#msg3891.A week later, on July 18, the Mt. Gox (“Mount Gox”) exchange platform was launched and officially announced on the forum by Jed. Leveraging his expertise, he ensured the platform functioned like an automated marketplace, akin to modern online exchanges. It stood out from Bitcoin Market by being “always online, automated,” with a “faster site and dedicated hosting,” and “a nicer interface39.” Consequently, Mt. Gox quickly became the primary means of acquiring bitcoins, serving as the reference point for dollar pricing.\nMining also entered a growth phase. The influx of new miners pushed the network’s hashing power (the number of calculations per second) above one billion calculations per second (1 GH/s) by July 13. Some miners developed their own GPU mining algorithms. One such miner, known as ArtForz, a German developer, began mining on July 19 and gradually built the first Bitcoin mining farm, later dubbed the “ArtFarm”40.\n40 On August 13, 2010, ArtForz’s mining farm consisted of six ATI Radeon HD 5770 graphics cards; eventually, it grew to include 24 ATI Radeon HD 5970 cards.—Tim Swanson, How ArtForz changed the history of Bitcoin mining, April 20, 2014: https://www.ofnumbers.com/2014/04/20/how-artforz-changed-the-history-of-bitcoin-mining/.However, this growth following the Slashdot article also led to technical challenges, testing the system’s resilience. Two incidents disrupted the project.\nThe first was the discovery of a vulnerability in Bitcoin’s code that allowed spending bitcoins from any address (later called the “1 RETURN bug” after the script needed to exploit it). ArtForz discovered this flaw at the end of July 2010. Instead of exploiting it to seize wealth on the network for personal gain, he chose to inform Satoshi and Gavin via email. Satoshi swiftly included a fix in the 0.3.6 update and recommended all users update their software. The vulnerability wasn’t exploited, allowing Bitcoin to avoid a potential disaster.\nThe second event was the “value overflow incident.” On August 15 around 5 PM, a mined block contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins. This creation exploited an overflow vulnerability in Bitcoin’s quantity representation. An hour later, the issue was spotted by Jeff Garzik, an American engineer who had discovered Bitcoin through Slashdot, who alerted the community on the forum41.\n41 Jeff Garzik, Strange block 74638, 08/15/2010 18:08:49 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.msg9474#msg9474.42 Satoshi Nakamoto, Development of alert system, 08/22/2010 23:55:06 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=898.msg10722#msg10722. This alert system was gradually deactivated between 2012 and 2015 and was ultimately removed from the software in 2017 (https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2016-11-01-alert-retirement).Satoshi’s response was immediate. Shortly before midnight, he released a fix that created an alternative chain excluding the problematic transaction. The conflict was resolved when the correct chain became longer than the other the next morning at 8:10 AM. This incident disrupted network activity for about 15 hours, but the problem was quickly resolved thanks to the community’s swift action. Following this incident, Satoshi implemented an alert system in Bitcoin to warn all network nodes of technical issues42.\nIn the fall, the growing popularity of GPU mining rendered CPU mining nearly obsolete. This led to the creation of the first mining pool on November 27, Bitcoin.cz Mining—a cooperative allowing small miners to stabilize their income by pooling their computing power43. Founded by Marek Palatinus (known as slush), a Czech IT architect, the cooperative would later be renamed Slush Pool in his honor.\n43 Marek Palatinus (slush), Cooperative mining, 11/27/2010 13:45:41 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1976.msg24844#msg24844.By the end of 2010, the Bitcoin project had truly taken off: the economy had strengthened, especially with exchange services; mining had specialized with GPU advancements; and the protocol had been tested through the discovery of software vulnerabilities. These developments showed that the incentives for the system’s various participants were aligned. It was at this point that Satoshi decided to disappear.",

    "text": "The Disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto\nSatoshi Nakamoto’s departure occurred gradually from December 2010 onward. He didn’t explicitly state his reasons for stepping back, but we can infer them. First, the project had gained momentum—it had grown to the point where leading it became challenging. More importantly, Satoshi feared the reaction of government agencies, a concern he expressed in a message dated July 5, 2010 (commenting on the draft Bitcoin presentation proposed for Slashdot), where he stated he didn’t want to overly highlight Bitcoin’s “anonymous” aspect or its opposition to legal authorities, as it would be a “provocation44.”\n44 “We don’t want to oversell the ‘anonymous’ aspect. (I intended to change the homepage.) ‘Developers expect that this may lead to a stable money supply than is out of the control of any central authority.’—I certainly don’t make any such claims or allude to any such provocations.”—Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Slashdot Submission for 1.0, 07/05/2010 21:31:14 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=234.msg1976#msg1976.45 The story of Bradley Manning (who became Chelsea Manning after gender transition) is recounted by Andy Greenberg in his 2012 book This Machine Kills Secrets.The trigger was the WikiLeaks affair. WikiLeaks is a non-profit, non-governmental organization founded by cypherpunk Julian Assange in 2006, aimed at providing a platform for whistleblowers and leaks while protecting their sources. Starting in 2010, confidential documents revealed by the NGO began gaining traction in major media outlets and influencing public opinion. Notably, the Afghan War Diary—a collection of secret U.S. military documents and reports on the war in Afghanistan, revealing, among other things, the concealment of civilian casualties—was published on July 25, 2010, thanks to contributions from Bradley Manning, a U.S. Army intelligence analyst45. Similarly, the Iraq War Logs were published on October 23, revealing civilian casualties and acts of torture from the 2004–2009 period.\nWikiLeaks relied heavily on public donations for funding—a sensitive activity for regulated firms wary of potential government retaliation. On October 14, 2010, the online payment company Moneybookers froze the NGO’s account. Following these revelations, it became increasingly likely that WikiLeaks would face more sanctions.\nOn November 10, Amir Taaki, a young Englishman of Iranian origin who had recently discovered Bitcoin, saw an opportunity in WikiLeaks’ situation to demonstrate Bitcoin’s resistance to censorship. He posted on the forum:\n“I wanted to send a letter to Wikileaks about Bitcoin because, unfortunately, they have had several incidents where their funds have been seized in the past. […] Does anyone know where to send them a message?46”\n46 Amir Taaki, Wikileaks contact info?, 11/10/2010 12:49:16 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1735.msg21271#msg21271.47 ShadowOfHarbringer, Re: Wikileaks contact info?, 11/10/2010 13:28:00 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1735.msg21283#msg21283.Reactions were mixed. One user noted, “It may be beneficial for wikileaks, but not necessarily for Bitcoin47.”\nA month later, on December 3, PayPal froze WikiLeaks’ account. Some forum members suggested encouraging WikiLeaks to accept bitcoin, noting it was the “ideal time to set up bitcoin donations48.” This prompted Satoshi to react the next day, opposing the idea:\n48 Wladimir van der Laan (wumpus), Re: Wikileaks contact info?, 12/04/2010 08:57:41 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1735.msg26737#msg26737.“The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way.\nI make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small, nascent community in its infancy. You wouldn’t get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage49.”\n49 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Wikileaks contact info?, 12/05/2010 09:08:08 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1735.msg26999#msg26999.In the following days, a full financial blockade against WikiLeaks was established, involving Mastercard, Visa, Western Union, Bank of America, and others, jeopardizing the NGO’s financial survival. Naturally, some insisted that Bitcoin be utilized.\nOn December 11, an article was published in PC World highlighting the possibility of WikiLeaks using Bitcoin. The article was quickly discussed on the forum, and Satoshi’s response was unequivocal. He wrote:\n“It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us50.”\n50 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: PC World Article on Bitcoin, 12/11/2010 23:39:16 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2216.msg29280#msg29280.This was his penultimate public message. The next day, he posted his final message on the forum to announce version 0.3.19 of the software, then disappeared. He handed over the reins of the project to his two trusted associates: Martti Malmi and Gavin Andresen.\nMartti Malmi inherited the website and forum. However, like Satoshi, he gradually distanced himself from Bitcoin, delegating management of these platforms to others, to whom he fully relinquished control in 201551. He sold his 55,000 bitcoins to buy an apartment near Helsinki.\n51 Control of the website was handed over to someone using the pseudonym Cøbra, while responsibility for the forum was given to Michael Marquardt (Theymos). The two co-manage these platforms.52 Gavin Andresen, Development process straw-man, 12/19/2010 16:41:39 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2367.msg31651#msg31651.Gavin Andresen inherited the alert key, the SourceForge repository, and the mailing list. On December 19, he announced he was “starting to lead the Bitcoin project more actively52” and created the Bitcoin GitHub repository, where the project would be developed going forward. He was unaware that he had become the lead developer and that Bitcoin’s creator was about to vanish.\nSatoshi disappeared entirely during the spring of 2011. On April 23, he sent a final email to Mike Hearn, the Google engineer who had approached him two years earlier and maintained contact. He wrote:\n“I’ve moved on to other things. [Bitcoin] is in good hands with Gavin and everyone53.” He also bid farewell to Gavin and Martti, requesting that Gavin avoid portraying him as a “shadowy figure” to the press54. On April 27, Gavin announced he had been invited by the CIA to give a presentation on Bitcoin—a visit that took place on June 14. Interestingly, this was also the day WikiLeaks began accepting bitcoin donations55. These events confirmed what Satoshi had feared.\n53 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Holding coins in an unspendable state for a rolling time window, 04/23/2011 13:40 UTC: https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread5.html.54 Allie Jones, “Former Coworker Regrets Helping Reveal Identity of Bitcoin’s Founder”, The Wire, March 6, 2014, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20140309041730/http://www.thewire.com/technology/2014/03/bitcoin-founders-coworker-regrets-doxxing-him/358878.55 “WikiLeaks now accepts anonymous bitcoin donations at 1HB5XMLmzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v”—WikiLeaks on Twitter, 06/14/2011 23:12 UTC: https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/80774521350668288.56 This amount was identified using the Patoshi Pattern, highlighted by Sergio Lerner in his 2013 article titled The Well Deserved Fortune of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin creator, Visionary and Genius (https://bitslog.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/). The estimate used here is from Whale Alert published in 2020: https://whale-alert.medium.com/the-satoshi-fortune-e49cf73f9a9b.Satoshi Nakamoto left behind a colossal fortune: 1,122,693 bitcoins, according to a 2020 estimate56. This represents more than 5% of the total bitcoin supply. These funds have remained untouched.\nA few messages purportedly from his accounts surfaced57, but they were assumed to be from hacked accounts.\n57 A message from Satoshi’s account on the P2P Foundation forum was posted on March 7, 2014, to deny association with Dorian Nakamoto (https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A52186), and an email opposing Bitcoin XT was sent on August 15, 2015, from his satoshi@vistomail.com address to the development mailing list (https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010238.html).58 Candidates often suggested as Satoshi Nakamoto include Nick Szabo, Hal Finney, Adam Back, and Len Sassaman.Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity remains unknown; he successfully maintained his anonymity using Tor and privacy-respecting services. In the ensuing years, this “shadowy figure” became a myth in his own right, sparking widespread speculation. People worldwide wondered, “Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?” much like characters question the identity of John Galt in Ayn Rand’s novel Atlas Shrugged. While various leads were pursued58, his true identity was never formally established.\nIn 2013, in one of his last forum messages, Hal Finney shared an enigmatic quote from the recently released film Man of Steel, encapsulating the mystery surrounding Bitcoin’s creator:\n“How do you find someone who has spent a lifetime covering his tracks? […] For some, he was a guardian angel. For others, [a mystery,] a ghost, always just out of reach. […] What does the ‘S’ stand for?59”\n59 Hal Finney, Re: Another Potential* Identifying Piece of Evidence on Satoshi*, 06/15/2013 01:23:42 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=234330.msg2479328#msg2479328.60 Leah McGrath Goodman, “The Face Behind Bitcoin”, Newsweek Magazine, March 6, 2014: https://www.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/face-behind-bitcoin-247957.html.61 Andy Greenberg, “Nakamoto’s Neighbor: My Hunt For Bitcoin’s Creator Led To A Paralyzed Crypto Genius”, Forbes, March 25, 2014: https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/25/satoshi-nakamotos-neighbor-the-bitcoin-ghostwriter-who-wasnt/.In March 2014, a Newsweek article suggested that Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto was the elusive creator60. This American naturalized Japanese engineer, living with his mother in Temple City near Los Angeles, was harassed by the press but adamantly denied the claim. It was later discovered that Hal Finney’s family had lived in the same area, “a few blocks from the Nakamoto family home,” during Hal’s adolescence, arousing further speculation61.\nHal Finney passed away in August 2014 due to Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS). As a forward-thinking individual, he chose to be cryonically preserved by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation.",

    "section": "The Community Takes Over",
    "text": "The Community Takes Over\nAs Satoshi gradually withdrew, Bitcoin’s popularity soared. Notably, the price of bitcoin rose favorably: from just 20 cents in December 2010, it reached parity with the dollar on February 9, 2011, and maintained it for some time. This price increase fueled enthusiasm within the community, including Hal Finney, who expressed feeling “very fortunate to have invested early in a new phenomenon that could be explosive62.”\n62 Hal Finney, Re: Parity Party, 01/11/2011 21:17:04 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2734.msg37307#msg37307.63 Ross Ulbricht (altoid), anonymous market online?, 01/27/2011 22:28 UTC: https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/13860995.This period coincided with the emergence of Silk Road—a darknet marketplace utilizing Tor and Bitcoin, allowing users to freely exchange legal and illegal products and services. Launched at the end of January by a young Texan named Ross Ulbricht, he mentioned it on the Bitcoin forum while pretending to have discovered the site by chance63.\nRoss Ulbricht was deeply committed to libertarian principles—a philosophy advocating for individual freedom, property rights, and free markets. For him, Silk Road embodied this ideal. Consequently, the range of products and services allowed on the site was limited and required that no harm be done to others: items included drugs, medications, precious metal coins, but excluded stolen credit cards, child pornography, or assassination services. The site primarily facilitated the sale of illicit drugs, especially small quantities of cannabis, for which it became notorious.\nPromotion of Bitcoin also intensified. On March 22, the first video explaining Bitcoin in qualitative terms was released64. Simply titled “What is Bitcoin?”, the video was produced by Stefan Thomas through community crowdfunding. Over the years, it achieved significant success, garnering several million views on YouTube. Similar videos multiplied thereafter.\n64 WeUseCoins, What is Bitcoin? (video), March 22, 2011: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo.Bitcoin was especially celebrated in libertarian circles, where its free, anonymous, and state-resistant attributes were emphasized. At the end of 2010, the webradio show FreeTalkLive began discussing Bitcoin and its illicit uses. This caught the attention of entrepreneur and activist Roger Ver, already a millionaire from his computer component resale company, Memory Dealers. He learned about Bitcoin in December 2010 and was instantly captivated. He devoured all available information, bought bitcoins, and arranged for his company to accept them a few months later. He quickly became one of Bitcoin’s most zealous promoters, earning the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus” for a time.\nThe existence of Silk Road was revealed to the public on June 1, 2011, through an article by Adrian Chen in Gawker65. This drew even more attention to Bitcoin, particularly by encouraging consumers to acquire bitcoins to shop on the platform.\n65 Adrian Chen, “The Underground Website Where You Can Buy Any Drug Imaginable”, Gawker, June 1, 2011: https://www.gawker.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160; archive: https://www.gawkerarchives.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160.During spring 2011, a significant surge in bitcoin’s price occurred due to increased demand. After stagnating for a few months, the price rose from $1 on April 15 to over $32 on June 8.\nMt. Gox, the main exchange platform at the time, came under pressure. Having been taken over a few months earlier by Mark Karpelès—a 26-year-old French developer living in Japan who was somewhat negligent and hadn’t resolved implementation issues from his predecessor—an unfortunate incident occurred on Sunday, June 19. Hackers accessed Jed McCaleb’s administrator account and attempted to extract as much money as possible.\nWith the daily withdrawal limit set at $1,000, the hackers aimed to crash the price to withdraw as many bitcoins as possible. They sold Jed McCaleb’s bitcoins on the market, causing a flash crash: the price, which had been around $17 that day, plummeted to $0.01 within minutes. Panic ensued, and many Mt. Gox users sold off to salvage what they could. The situation was stabilized by day’s end, but 2,000 bitcoins were unaccounted for. On June 23, Mark Karpelès demonstrated the company’s solvency by moving 424,242 bitcoins from one address to another66.\n66 The transaction identifier for Mt. Gox’s 2011 solvency proof was 3a1b9e330d32fef1ee42f8e86420d2be978bbe0dc5862f17da9027cf9e11f8c4.This incident marked the end of the speculative frenzy, and the price began a gradual decline. Around this time, MyBitcoin shut down: in early August, the service went bankrupt following the disappearance of 78,740 bitcoins—51% of client funds. Evidence suggested that its anonymous founder, Tom Williams, orchestrated the theft. In the days following, the price steeply dropped to $6 and eventually fell to $2 by November.\nDespite these setbacks, community members remained undeterred. From August 19 to 21, 2011, the first Bitcoin conference was held in New York, organized by Bruce Wagner, host of The Bitcoin Show, a program featuring interviews with ecosystem participants67. The conference had an amateur feel, typical of the community at the time, with only four presentations: those by Bruce Wagner, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, and Stefan Thomas. Nonetheless, it allowed key figures like Roger Ver, Jesse Powell, Jed McCaleb, Mark Karpelès, and Charlie Lee to meet in person for the first time.\n67 Bruce Wagner’s YouTube channel is available at https://www.youtube.com/@vlogwrap. Videos of the conference presentations can be found there.68 Jeff Garzik, [Bitcoin-development] Preparing 0.3.23-rc1 release, 06/12/2011 02:23:58 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2011-June/000000.html.69 The BIP system was initially proposed on September 19, 2011, by Amir Taaki as Bitcoin Enhancement Proposals, directly referencing the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP) that inspired it (Amir Taaki, [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin Enhancement Proposals (BEPS), 09/19/2011 00:31:55 UTC, https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2011-September/000554.html).Software development also became more structured. Previously centralized under Satoshi’s “benevolent dictatorship,” development opened to community contributions under Gavin Andresen’s supervision following Satoshi’s departure. Talented contributors began influencing Bitcoin’s evolution, including Nils Schneider, Matt Corallo, Pieter Wuille, Jeff Garzik, Wladimir van der Laan, Luke-Jr, and Gregory Maxwell. Coordination methods were established, such as the bitcoin-development mailing list for formal discussions68 and the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) system to publicly outline changes69.\nUsing Bitcoin became easier. Lightweight wallets emerged, allowing users to transact without downloading and verifying the entire blockchain. These wallets utilized Simplified Payment Verification, described by Satoshi Nakamoto in section 8 of the white paper. Mike Hearn implemented this in his Java-based library BitCoinJ, improving compatibility with Android smartphones. The first mobile wallet, Bitcoin Wallet for Android, was launched by Andreas Schildbach in March 2011, demonstrating everyday usability. On desktops, Thomas Voegtlin created Electrum in November 2011, offering wallet recovery through a mnemonic phrase—a practice later standardized across the ecosystem.\nHowever, decentralized development also led to tensions. Without its founder, the project lacked an undisputed leader. While Gavin Andresen controlled the repository, he didn’t have the technical authority to unilaterally impose his views. Decisions were made collectively, raising questions about Bitcoin’s governance: who decides protocol changes?\nAt the end of 2011 and early 2012, the first technical debate without Satoshi occurred. Though the developer group was small, a conflict arose over improving transaction programmability to enable multi-signature accounts—a debate remembered as the “battle for P2SH70.”\n70 Pete Rizzo, Aaron van Wirdum, “The Battle For P2SH: The Untold Story Of The First Bitcoin War”, Bitcoin Magazine, December 4, 2020: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-battle-for-p2sh-the-untold-story-of-the-first-bitcoin-war.Bitcoin, as programmable money, allows users to set conditions for locking and unlocking funds using scripting with logical instructions called opcodes. However, these scripts are complex to manage. A need arose for a simple way for users to send funds to a recipient-defined script. Nicolas van Saberhagen proposed adding a new opcode called OP_EVAL. This proposal had recursion issues, leading to two competing proposals: Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) by Gavin Andresen and OP_CHECKHASHVERIFY (CHV) by Luke-Jr.\nTension between these proposals sparked debate. Amir Taaki, supporting neither, called for open discussion on January 29, 2012:\n“My fear is that one day Bitcoin will be corrupted. Developers: consider this additional scrutiny as an opportunity to build a culture of openness71.”\n71 Amir Taaki, The Truth behind BIP 16 and 17 (important read), 01/29/2012 03:54:08 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=61705.msg719790#msg719790.Ultimately, P2SH was chosen for integration into Bitcoin under Gavin Andresen’s directive, implemented on April 1, 2012, despite challenges.\nSimultaneously, Bitcoin’s popularization continued. On February 28, Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin, just 18, co-founded Bitcoin Magazine with Romanian developer Mihai Alisie. Initially a web-only publication, it began print distribution in May. Vitalik authored numerous articles documenting current events. Other specialized news sites like CoinDesk and CoinTelegraph soon emerged.\nOn April 24, 2012, entrepreneur Erik Voorhees launched SatoshiDICE, an online gambling game72. Players sent bitcoins to specific addresses, with predefined probabilities of receiving rewards—a straightforward, verifiable process that attracted many gamblers.\n72 Erik Voorhees, SatoshiDICE.com - The World’s Most Popular Bitcoin Game, 04/24/2012 02:17:31 UTC, archive: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77870.msg865877#msg865877.A staunch libertarian living in New Hampshire, Voorhees viewed SatoshiDICE as a means to bypass regulations. On August 20, he even conducted an IPO for his company on the Romanian platform MPEx. He sold the platform on July 17, 2013, for 126,315 bitcoins, worth $12.4 million at the time.\nSatoshiDICE’s success significantly increased blockchain transactions, tripling them in months. This surge, primarily from the site, was noted and even labeled as “spam” by some developers73. By mid-2012, Bitcoin was fully operational and poised for broader discovery.\n73 Matt Corallo, Huge increase in satoshidice spam over the past day, 06/13/2012 23:21:47 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=87444.msg961132#msg961132.",

    "text": "The Organic Bootstrapping of Bitcoin\nBitcoin’s early years were pivotal for its success. It grew discreetly, experiencing organic and cautious development, sheltered from opportunism and propaganda.\nProposed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto and implemented in January 2009, Bitcoin’s beginnings were challenging—it took nine months for bitcoin to acquire a price! Satoshi devoted himself entirely to his creation without ever leveraging his accumulated fortune personally. By disappearing in 2011, he ultimately entrusted the community with the project.\nForged in a crucible of cypherpunks, anarchists, libertarians, and other freedom enthusiasts, Bitcoin was built in opposition to the traditional state-banking system dominated by censorship and public bailouts. This is why Bitcoin’s message is so radical, inspiring passion in many.\nBetween 2010 and 2012, Bitcoin’s first use cases emerged: funding politically sensitive projects, online gambling, remote drug purchases, remittances abroad—activities at the edge of legality or outright illegal—demonstrating bitcoin’s effectiveness as an uncensorable and relatively anonymous currency. This trend was quickly tempered, as seen in subsequent years.",

    "text": "Financialization\nThe financialization of Bitcoin is marked by the professionalization of exchange activities between bitcoin and state currencies—formally known as currency exchange—and the entry of traditional players into the ecosystem. This phase is accompanied by an unprecedented price surge, increased market liquidity, tightened regulatory constraints, and a shift in the dominant discourse within the community.\nThe need for currency exchange services became apparent very quickly. Generally, people own, earn, and spend fiat currencies like the dollar or the euro, not bitcoin. Thus, even though Bitcoin is theoretically independent of the traditional system, bridges between the two worlds are essential, at least temporarily.\nStarting in 2011, there was an unprecedented rise in marketplaces—online exchanges that automatically process clients’ buy and sell orders. Notably, Mt. Gox emerged as a pivotal platform for converting bitcoins to dollars, despite a rocky start. It quickly became a central hub, handling a daily volume of at least $200,000 and sometimes surpassing a million dollars. Other platforms like Bitstamp, Bitcoin-Central, TradeHill, and BTC-e also emerged but couldn’t compete with Mt. Gox, which continued to account for 90% of the total market volume throughout its existence.\nIn addition to spot trading platforms (where actual assets are exchanged), margin trading platforms began to appear, allowing users to trade contracts, leverage positions, and engage in short selling. The first of these was Bitcoinica, which had a tumultuous existence from September 2011 to May 2012 before being succeeded by Bitfinex in October 2012.\nSimultaneously, a service called BitInstant was developing in the United States. Co-founded in June 2011 by Gareth Nelson and Charlie Shrem, its role was to facilitate transfers to and from exchange platforms. The company acted as an intermediary between clients and platforms, enabling instant deposits and withdrawals for a fee. Charlie Shrem, a young New Yorker of Syrian Jewish descent, served as CEO and quickly became the company’s leading figure, although others like Roger Ver and Erik Voorhees were also involved. By early 2012, BitInstant offered various money transfer methods (Liberty Reserve, Dwolla, Paxum, cash deposits, etc.) to interact with major platforms in the ecosystem, including Japan-based Mt. Gox. By April 2013, BitInstant’s activity accounted for about 30% of the total volume traded on exchange platforms1.\nBut marketplaces weren’t the only services flourishing. First, custodial applications that allowed users to easily send and receive bitcoins without managing their own holdings began to develop, with MyBitcoin being a pioneer between 2010 and 2011. Coinbase, founded in May 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, started as a “hosted Bitcoin wallet”2 and gradually integrated typical exchange functionalities over the years.\nSecond, payment processors emerged, enabling merchants to receive bitcoins and instantly sell them to avoid volatility. BitPay, founded in May 2011 by Tony Gallippi and Stephen Pair, quickly became a go-to solution for many merchants.\nThird, peer-to-peer exchange services also multiplied, allowing individuals to swap bitcoins using various payment methods, including in-person cash exchanges. The most famous is LocalBitcoins, founded in June 2012 by Jeremias Kangas, which inspired other similar platforms. Similarly, over-the-counter (OTC) markets developed, allowing wealthier individuals to conduct large private trades without immediately impacting market prices.\nThus, the range of financial services expanded considerably between 2012 and 2013, driven by strong demand from clients increasingly eager to acquire bitcoin. This demand was evidenced by Bitcoin’s appearance in popular culture, notably inaugurated by the January 15, 2012, episode of The Good Wife, which focused entirely on Bitcoin3.\nInterest from traditional financial players made a significant difference. Wealthy investors began to take notice of bitcoin due to its limited supply (the famous 21 million cap) and its technologically disruptive potential. They invested not only in bitcoin but also in ecosystem companies.\nBarry Silbert, a Wall Street aficionado who made his fortune with SecondMarket—a company facilitating secondary market asset trading—became interested in bitcoin in 2012 and purchased hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth. He later founded Grayscale Investments in 2013 and the Digital Currency Group in 2015.\nTwin brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, known for their dispute with Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook’s creation (settled for $65 million), learned about Bitcoin in August 2012 through David Azar, an associate of Charlie Shrem. After meeting Shrem, they were convinced to invest in bitcoin and later invested in his company BitInstant in May 2013. They eventually founded the Gemini exchange platform.\nArgentine entrepreneur and philanthropist Wences Casares bought bitcoin in February 2013 and later founded Xapo, now one of the world’s largest bitcoin custodians for individuals.\nThis financialization brought a substantial influx of money but also shifted the discourse. Due to its fixed monetary policy, bitcoin was increasingly seen as an investment—a profit-generating asset due to the growth of its economy. Consequently, it was less viewed as a currency enabling value exchange between individuals without bank or state intervention.\nUnlike cypherpunks and libertarians, the new investors weren’t particularly anarchistic, often belonging to the traditional financial world and adhering closely to regulations. For them, it was necessary for Bitcoin’s most controversial uses to disappear for it to develop and reach the general public and institutional investors. Specifically, they frowned upon the Silk Road marketplace, which at the time accounted for 10–20% of Bitcoin’s economic activity4 and gave Bitcoin its reputation as the “Internet’s drug money.” The trend was thus to improve the cryptocurrency’s image—a strategy initially set in motion by Satoshi Nakamoto himself between 2010 and 2011, as discussed in Chapter 1.\nIn this vein, the Bitcoin Foundation was established in September 2012. Modeled after the Linux Foundation, it was a consortium of ecosystem companies aimed at funding the software infrastructure of the protocol, lobbying regulators, and improving Bitcoin’s public image5. It was managed by key ecosystem figures: Peter Vessenes (CEO of CoinLab), Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin’s lead developer), Mark Karpelès (CEO of Mt. Gox), Jon Matonis (cryptographer and economist), Patrick Murck (a lawyer specializing in virtual currencies), and Charlie Shrem (CEO of BitInstant).\nOn November 28, 2012, the first “halving” occurred: the protocol’s monetary creation was halved, reducing the block reward from 50 bitcoins to 25 bitcoins, lowering the annualized issuance rate to 12.5%. The transition went smoothly. A few days later, Matt Whitlock created a simple graph visualizing the evolution of bitcoin creation over time6 (see Figure 2.1). This confirmed the shift in focus from uncensorability to scarcity.\nThe increased demand and decreased supply growth rate led to a noticeable rise in bitcoin’s price. While it hovered around $5 during the first part of 2012, it climbed to $13 in August and stabilized at that level by year’s end. In 2013, its growth became exponential: surpassing $20 in January, it broke the previous high of $30 in February, and eventually reached $266 on Mt. Gox in April.\nSymbolically, this price surge coincided with the collapse of Cypriot banks. At that time, the financial crisis was in full swing on the island, prompting the financial system to take drastic measures. On March 16, 2013, banks limited customer withdrawals. On the 25th, the Cypriot government and the EU decided (without prior legal framework) that the Bank of Cyprus had to be internally recapitalized through a partial tax on deposits over €100,000. The Laiki Bank, the country’s second-largest bank, was dismantled following its bankruptcy, and holdings over €100,000 were simply confiscated. This event demonstrated Bitcoin’s utility as “digital gold” that can be directly owned and isn’t subject to fractional-reserve banking constraints7.\nMeanwhile, developments were also unfolding with Silk Road. The U.S. intelligence investigation, which began in June 2011 following Adrian Chen’s Gawker article and Senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin’s calls to shut down the platform, started bearing fruit. After lengthy research and some questionable actions by investigators8, Ross Ulbricht, the platform’s founder, was suspected by June 2013. Gary Alford, an IRS agent, uncovered the trail by finding Ross’s initial announcement on the Bitcoin forum and linking it to his email address, which contained his real name. In July 2013, Silk Road’s server was seized by Icelandic police and a copy was shared with U.S. agencies. The history contained a connection from an IP address in San Francisco, near Ross’s residence. In September, armed with this information, Ross was identified.\nSilk Road’s downfall occurred in early fall 2013. On October 1, Ross Ulbricht was apprehended by FBI agents in a San Francisco library, with his session open on the platform. The following day, the website was shut down, causing a stir in the community. Bitcoin’s price, which had been stabilizing around $125 in previous days, plummeted to a low of $85. Between October 2 and 25, nearly 174,000 bitcoins belonging to Ross were seized by federal agencies—a treasure worth about $31 million at the time9.\nOthers associated with Silk Road were arrested and convicted in the following years. Charlie Shrem was apprehended on January 27, 2014, by federal agents (FBI, IRS, DEA) and charged with facilitating money laundering through his company BitInstant. In December 2014, he was sentenced to two years in prison for illicit transfers. Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to two life terms plus 40 years, all for non-violent charges, explicitly to make an example of him10.\nDespite Silk Road’s collapse representing the destruction of a significant portion of Bitcoin’s economy, the price rebounded, aligning with the expectations of some major investors. Renewed enthusiasm for Bitcoin led to another price surge and new highs. Stabilizing above $100, the price gradually increased in the latter half of October, surpassing the previous high of $266 in early November. From there, it skyrocketed, reaching a new all-time high of $1,240 on Mt. Gox on December 4, 2013. This speculative episode prompted many media outlets to discuss Bitcoin for the first time.\nHowever, Mt. Gox, the epicenter of speculative activity, was more fragile than it appeared. The platform had suffered cyberattacks throughout its existence, leading to the gradual disappearance of funds. By early 2014, over 650,000 bitcoins were missing from the company’s coffers, amounting to $381 million at the time11!\nIn February 2014, Mt. Gox collapsed. After suspending withdrawals on the 7th, the site went offline on the 25th, and bankruptcy was declared on the 28th. Mark Karpelès publicly apologized on Japanese television. This crisis was catastrophic for Bitcoin: the primary hub of its economy shut down, wealthy holders who kept their bitcoins on the platform lost everything, and public trust (which equated Bitcoin with Mt. Gox) plummeted. This event ended the speculative frenzy of 2013–2014.\nMark Karpelès was suspected of embezzlement, tarnishing his reputation. He was arrested by Japanese authorities in August 2015, earning him the nickname “the baron of bitcoin” in French media. Later, it was shown that the platform’s losses resulted from multiple hacks between 2011 and 2014 and that Karpelès was only negligent and unaware of the flaw that allowed most bitcoins to be withdrawn during that period.\nNevertheless, Mt. Gox’s downfall cleansed the exchange market. Platforms began sharing the market more evenly, with activity distributed among players like Bitfinex, bitFlyer, Bitstamp, Bittrex, BTCChina, BTC-e, Coinbase, Gemini, OKEx, Kraken, and Poloniex.",

    "section": "The Scalability Debate",
    "text": "The Scalability Debate\nThe second major episode in Bitcoin’s history was the scalability debate, focusing on the system’s ability to scale—that is, to continue functioning effectively as the number of users increases. This discord began in 2013, characterized by a sharp rise in price and activity. It escalated into a civil war in 2015 and concluded in 2017 with a schism into two distinct communities following the creation of a new network called Bitcoin Cash and the cancellation of the (artificial) SegWit2X compromise. This period was a significant learning phase for the community. On one hand, it became aware of Bitcoin’s imperfections, which had been heralded as a decentralized digital currency system allowing instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world, with minimal fees12. On the other hand, the community recognized the complex governance mechanism underlying the protocol’s evolution (see chs. 10 and 11).\n12 On May 18, Bitcoin.org’s homepage described Bitcoin as a digital currency system enabling “instant peer-to-peer transactions […] worldwide” with “low or zero processing fees,” noting that “transaction management and bitcoin issuance are carried out collectively by the network.”—Bitcoin.org archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20130518024528/http://bitcoin.org/en/.The scalability debate centered on a parameter in the protocol that restricted the system’s transactional capacity: the block size limit. In Bitcoin, transactions are included in blocks added to the chain every 10 minutes on average; limiting block size effectively imposes a quota on the number of confirmed transactions.\nIn 2013, the block size limit was 1 megabyte (1 MB), corresponding to a theoretical maximum throughput of 7.37 transactions per second. This limit, added to the protocol by Satoshi Nakamoto on September 12, 2010, without public announcement, was initially meant to prevent denial-of-service attacks and was intended to increase over time13. However, after the founder’s abrupt departure, the decision was left to community members, setting the stage for conflict.\n13 On October 4, 2010, Satoshi discussed on the forum how to implement increasing the block size limit.—Satoshi Nakamoto, “Re: [PATCH] increase block size limit”, October 4, 2010, 19:48:40 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366.Two main camps emerged in the debate. The first was the proponents of larger blocks, or “big blockers,” who aligned themselves with Satoshi’s original vision and sought to upgrade the protocol to increase or even remove the limit. The opposing camp consisted of proponents of smaller blocks, or “small blockers,” who wanted to restrict block size to minimize the cost of running a node.\nThe first vision, initially the majority, believed that progressively increasing the block size limit could be achieved without endangering the system’s integrity. This view held that Bitcoin should remain a payment protocol adaptable to demand without increasing transaction fees. It favored usability over security, accepted hard forks (protocol upgrades incompatible with previous versions requiring network-wide coordination), and represented a more progressive stance. Its proponents generally believed that miners determined the protocol. Developers like Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, and Jeff Garzik championed this approach.\nThe second vision, which gained traction from 2013 onward, focused on security at the expense of usability. Its goal was to minimize node operation costs to maximize network decentralization. This view considered Bitcoin primarily as a settlement protocol serving as a foundation for layered systems, which could be centralized or decentralized. It advocated for soft forks—backward-compatible protocol upgrades enabled by miners, allowing gradual user adoption. This was a more conservative position, though it acknowledged the need for certain essential changes. Its proponents generally believed that users upheld the protocol’s integrity. Developers like Pieter Wuille, Gregory Maxwell, Wladimir van der Laan, and Luke-Jr supported this approach.\nWithin both camps, nuances and contradictions existed. The scalability issue was complex and technical, leading to a variety of positions, especially regarding the optimal block size limit: 1 MB, 2 MB, 8 MB?\nThe opposition first manifested within the Bitcoin software project, where the lead contributors predominantly supported smaller blocks. In spring 2014, the software underwent significant changes. Aesthetically, it was renamed “Bitcoin Core” on March 19 to “reduce confusion between Bitcoin-the-network and Bitcoin-the-software”14. Functionally, a power transition occurred on April 7 when Gavin Andresen handed over his lead maintainer role to Wladimir van der Laan to focus on his duties as Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation.\n14 Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0 released, March 19, 2014: https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.9.0#rebranding-to-bitcoin-core.This management change materialized that year when Mike Hearn saw his proposal to add the getutxos network request rejected due to lack of unanimity within the Bitcoin Core team. Hearn needed this functionality for his crowdfunding application, Lighthouse. Consequently, he created Bitcoin XT in December 2014, an alternative implementation derived from Bitcoin Core that included the desired changes while remaining compatible with the network.\nSimultaneously, the discord spread throughout the community. The small block philosophy gained traction, notably through a video produced by developer Peter Todd in 2013 explaining “why the block size limit keeps Bitcoin free and decentralized”15. Another argument invoked was the fee market, highlighted by French economist Nicolas Houy, who explained in a 2014 article that “letting transaction fees result from a market and making block size irrelevant or non-binding would lead to too low a security level for Bitcoin”16. Additionally, small block proponents sought to justify their stance by proposing scalability solutions that would increase the economic activity supported by the network without significantly enlarging block size.\n15 Keep Bitcoin Free, “Why the blocksize limit keeps Bitcoin free and decentralized” (video), May 17, 2013: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZp7UGgBR0I.16 Nicolas Houy, The economics of Bitcoin transaction fees, GATE, 2014.—This idea, called the “fee fatal spiral,” was proposed as early as 2011 by a user on Bitcointalk. See Vandroiy, “[If tx limit is removed] Disturbingly low future difficulty equilibrium”, April 22, 2011: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6284.msg92187#msg92187.17 Blockstream, Why We Founded Blockstream, October 22, 2014, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20161022162335/https://www.blockstream.com/2014/10/23/why-we-are-co-founders-of-blockstream.html.The first proposal was sidechains, or pegged sidechains—secondary chains running parallel to the main chain, to and from which bitcoins could be transferred via a two-way peg. This concept was first presented in a technical paper on October 22, 2014, by developers from Blockstream. Co-founded by Adam Back, Bitcoin Core developers, and finance figures, Blockstream aimed to “find an architecturally sound and permissionless way to extend Bitcoin’s capabilities, allowing the cryptocurrency to reach its full potential”17. Initially, it focused on developing sidechains, leading to the Elements model and its implementation, Liquid.\nThe second proposal was the Lightning Network—a network of payment channels built atop Bitcoin, enabling instant, near-free peer-to-peer transfers. The concept was presented in February 2015 by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja during a developer seminar in San Francisco. On February 28, they published the white paper titled “The Bitcoin Lightning Network,” outlining the basics needed to build such a network18. Implementing Lightning smoothly required modifying the Bitcoin protocol by adding time locks to the scripting language and correcting a flaw known as transaction malleability19.\n18 Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, The Bitcoin Lightning Network DRAFT Version 0.5, February 28, 2015: https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper-DRAFT-0.5.pdf.19 Transaction malleability is the ability to slightly modify a transaction after it’s broadcast on the network, changing its identifier. This capability disappears once the transaction is confirmed by a miner who includes it in a chain block.These two proposals envisioned scaling through layering, which wouldn’t rely entirely on trusted third parties and wouldn’t compromise the entire chain’s security.\nBig block proponents focused on optimizing the software and protocol to lighten node workloads. On October 6, 2014, Gavin Andresen published a roadmap on the Bitcoin Foundation’s blog describing how increased network activity could be offset by protocol changes and exponential technological advancements described by Moore’s and Nielsen’s laws20. The article mentioned block pruning to reduce the stored chain size, UTXO commitments to speed up initial block downloads, and block relay via Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables for efficiency.\n20 Gavin Andresen, A Scalability Roadmap, October 6, 2014, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20150321091124/http://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org:80/a-scalability-roadmap.By spring 2015, with average block sizes approaching 500 KB, the idea of increasing the network’s transactional capacity resurfaced under Gavin Andresen’s impetus. In the following months, several proposals emerged, including Gavin’s suggestion to raise the limit to 8 MB (BIP-101), aligning with Chinese mining pools’ wishes, and Pieter Wuille’s proposal to increase the limit by 17.7% annually (BIP-103). Unfortunately, none of the proposals satisfied all parties, intensifying the community conflict into a full-blown civil war.",

    "section": "The Block Size War",
    "text": "The Block Size War\nThe conflict over block size took a critical turn in summer 2015 with the release of Bitcoin XT version 0.11A on August 15, which included an increase in the block size limit—an incompatible change with network rules21. The integrated upgrade was BIP-101, programming an increase of the limit from 1 MB to 8 MB, conditional on attaining sufficient miner signaling—specifically, 75% of the network’s hash power. As such, this software version risked causing a network split and a chain fork into two distinct chains.\n21 Mike Hearn, Why is Bitcoin forking?, August 15, 2015: https://medium.com/faith-and-future/why-is-bitcoin-forking-d647312d22c1.22 FAQ—BitcoinXT (archive): https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031806/https://bitcoinxt.software/faq.html#who-is-involved.Bitcoin XT was led by Mike Hearn, who described himself as a “benevolent dictator” (a common concept in the open-source world). Gavin Andresen participated in the project and had input on its direction, but “Mike made the final decisions in case of severe disputes”22. Increasing the block size limit was supported by major Chinese mining pools and some industry companies.\nTo a core group of the community, this movement resembled a forceful takeover, prompting a visceral response. On the night of August 16–17, Michael Marquardt (a.k.a. Theymos), the main moderator of the r/Bitcoin subreddit and co-administrator of the Bitcointalk forum, published a lengthy Reddit post announcing the banning of all discussions about Bitcoin XT23. In it, he explained why he considered Bitcoin XT incompatible with Bitcoin and thus undeserving of discussion on the subreddit. Since most conversations occurred on r/Bitcoin at the time, this decision had a significant impact.\n23 Michael Marquardt (Theymos), “It’s time for a break: About the recent mess & temporary new rules”, August 17, 2015, 00:50:15: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/.24 The English term comes from Jonathan Bier’s book The Blocksize War, published in 2021. The French term was coined by Morgan Phuc in 2017: https://bitconseil.fr/bitcoin-guerre-blocs/.25 Alex Hern, “Bitcoin’s forked: chief scientist launches alternative proposal for the currency”, The Guardian, August 17, 2015: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/17/bitcoin-xt-alternative-cryptocurrency-chief-scientist.The emergence of Bitcoin XT marked the beginning of a civil war within the community, known as the “block size war” or “Blocksize War”24, during which diplomacy gradually gave way to animosity. On August 17, journalist Alex Hern wrote in The Guardian: “The bitcoin war has begun”25. The period was characterized by intense propaganda from both sides, censorship on major communication channels, and denial-of-service attacks against nodes running Bitcoin XT and its successors.\nInitially, many sought to ease the conflict and called for discussion. This led to the “Scaling Bitcoin” conferences, organized to present various ways to scale Bitcoin. The first edition took place in September in Montreal, successfully bringing together individuals from both camps in good faith. The second edition occurred in December in Hong Kong, where tensions were already more palpable.\nDuring Scaling Bitcoin II, a new proposal for Bitcoin was presented: Segregated Witness, or SegWit. Imagined by Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille, it aimed to facilitate Lightning Network implementation (by correcting transaction malleability) and increase transactional capacity in a backward-compatible way for non-mining nodes. It was part of Gregory Maxwell’s roadmap published that day on the mailing list26 and quickly became the upgrade championed by small block proponents.\n26 Gregory Maxwell, “[bitcoin-dev] Capacity increases for the Bitcoin system”, December 7, 2015, 22:02:17 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html.27 Mike Hearn, The resolution of the Bitcoin experiment, January 14, 2016: https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7.28 “Bitcoin Classic emerged from the ashes of the XT vs. Core debate. It’s a version of Bitcoin that would allow a two-megabyte limit, setting rules to increase it over time. It seems to be rapidly gaining support.”—Paul Vigna, “Is Bitcoin Breaking Up?”, The Wall Street Journal, January 17, 2016, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20160117220315/https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-bitcoin-breaking-up-1453044493.At the beginning of 2016, Bitcoin XT failed, and Mike Hearn left the community in a high-profile resignation27. However, a new implementation emerged among big block supporters: Bitcoin Classic. It incorporated a modified version of BIP-101, proposing a 2 MB block size limit upon reaching 75% network hash power signaling. Bitcoin Classic quickly gained popularity, prompting concern from the opposing camp28.\nOn February 20, 2016, an emergency meeting was held in Hong Kong. This “roundtable” brought together major mining pools, some ecosystem companies, and key Bitcoin Core contributors like Matt Corallo, Peter Todd, and Luke-Jr. After hours of pressured discussions, participants reached an agreement, later known as the Hong Kong Agreement. Developers agreed to implement SegWit and double the base block size limit, while miners committed to activating SegWit and using only Bitcoin Core29.\n29 Bitcoin Roundtable, Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus, February 20, 2016: https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff.However, this sense of compromise didn’t last, as two events in 2016 changed the dynamics. The first was the involvement of Craig S. Wright, an Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. He was thrust into the spotlight in December 2015 following independent investigations by Wired and Gizmodo, which suggested he might be Bitcoin’s creator. The investigations were based on evidence indicating he might have been involved in cryptocurrency development alongside his friend Dave Kleiman, who died in 2013.\nA few months later, on May 2, 2016, Craig Wright published a lengthy and convoluted blog post30, including a signature corresponding to the public key used to receive the block 9 reward and send the first payment to Hal Finney in January 2009. Additionally, a BBC interview with Wright was released that day, in which he claimed to have been the “main part” of Satoshi Nakamoto but that “other people helped [him]”31. He also claimed to have signed a message privately in front of the interviewing journalist.\n30 Craig Wright, Jean-Paul Sartre, Signing and Significance, May 2, 2016, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20160502072011/http://www.drcraigwright.net/jean-paul-sartre-signing-significance/.31 BBC News, Mr Bitcoin: “I don’t want money, I don’t want fame!” (video), May 2, 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DCAC1j2HTY.32 The signature provided by Craig Wright corresponds to the public key linked to address 12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S, which received the block 9 reward and sent the first payment to Hal Finney on January 12, 2009, and was thus produced by Satoshi Nakamoto. A Reddit user (JoukeH) quickly discovered it was the signature of an existing transaction on the chain: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hf4xj/creator_of_bitcoin_reveals_identity/d2pf70v/.However, it quickly became apparent that the documents provided in the investigations and the elements presented by Wright himself were unconvincing. Specifically, the signature in the blog post was discovered to be the signature of an existing transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, simply encoded differently32. This fact prompted caution within the community.\nThat same day, Gavin Andresen published an article stating he believed Craig Wright was “the person who invented Bitcoin,” as Wright had shown him “messages signed with keys only Satoshi should possess” in person33. Consequently, Gavin’s maintainer role and commit access to the Bitcoin Core repository were revoked immediately, ostensibly because the team feared his account had been hacked. Overall, this dubious assertion, confirmed in person at the Consensus 2016 conference, discredited him, and his GitHub access was never restored. He later acknowledged being deceived.\n33 Gavin Andresen, Satoshi, May 2, 2016: http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshiThe second event influencing the conflict didn’t occur within the Bitcoin community but on Ethereum, an alternative system launched in 2015 dedicated to smart contracts. It was the split between Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) following TheDAO hack.\nOn June 17, 2016, TheDAO—a decentralized autonomous organization aimed at investing in the ecosystem—was hacked, and 3.6 million ethers (Ethereum’s unit of account) worth $50 million were stolen, representing 4.4% of the total ether supply at the time. The community decided by a large majority to simply reverse the theft by altering the system’s state. A month later, on July 20, the change was implemented, leading to a chain split: one following the modified protocol (which became the majority and retained the name Ethereum) and one following the original protocol (which became the minority and was called Ethereum Classic). Holders ended up with different ethers on both sides.\nThis split wasn’t clean. Notably, it didn’t include replay protection, meaning transactions made on one chain could be replicated on the other by a third party, leading to replay attacks. This disrupted exchanges that had to contend with the issue. Consequently, although the combined price of both ethers eventually surpassed the initial ether’s price, everyone could observe the negative effects of a hard fork-induced split. This example reinforced small block proponents’ conservative stance advocating for protocol evolution through soft forks like SegWit.\nDue to these events, the big block camp emerged from 2016 significantly weakened, both reputation-wise and in terms of arguments.\nIt was at this point that Bitcoin Core developers initiated miner signaling for SegWit, starting November 15, 2016, for a one-year period. The upgrade required 95% hash power signaling to activate, aiming to ensure widespread backward compatibility.\nHowever, major mining pools refused SegWit (for various reasons34), and during the initial months, the proportion of blocks signaling support stagnated around 25%, far from the required threshold. SegWit was stalled.\n34 SegWit notably nullified the effects of the secret AsicBoost, a mining optimization technique. See Gregory Maxwell, “[bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Inhibiting a covert attack on the Bitcoin POW function”, April 5, 2017, 21:37:45 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-April/013996.html.At the beginning of 2017, blocks began to fill up, leading to a significant increase in transaction fees and confirmation times on the chain. By mid-February, median fees exceeded 30 cents for the first time in Bitcoin’s history. In this context, pressure for change grew on both sides.\nOne side rallied around Bitcoin Unlimited, an implementation that gained popularity among big block supporters during summer 2016, succeeding Bitcoin Classic. It was notably backed by Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, who had become an influential community figure35, providing substantial funding for Bitcoin Unlimited. By March 2017, signaling for Unlimited surpassed that of SegWit.\n35 Roger Ver is known for promoting bitcoin adoption among merchants and his prominent role in the documentary The Bitcoin Gospel, released on November 1, 2015, on YouTube. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zKuoqZLyKg&t=2831s.However, on March 17, the possibility of a contentious hard fork prompted exchanges to consider the potential currency created by Bitcoin Unlimited as an alternative cryptocurrency. Drawing on their experience with the ETH and ETC split, they demanded that it include replay protection; otherwise, it wouldn’t even be listed. This decision was devastating for big block proponents.\nOn the other side, pressure to activate SegWit intensified among small block supporters, who were growing impatient. On March 12, 2017, an individual known as Shaolin Fry published a proposal for a User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) that would lock in the upgrade without miner signaling by August 136. This bold measure was dangerous and didn’t gain unanimous support among small blockers, as illustrated by Gregory Maxwell’s opposition.\n36 Shaolin Fry, “[bitcoin-dev] Flag day activation of segwit”, March 12, 2017, 15:50:27 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-March/013714.html.However, the UASF threat existed and exerted influence. Faced with the community’s desire for SegWit, major ecosystem players (companies and miners) were compelled to sign an agreement on May 23, 2017, on the sidelines of the Consensus 2017 conference in New York. This New York Agreement, as it became known, represented a theoretical compromise in the raging conflict: signatories committed to activating SegWit with an 80% hash power threshold and doubling the block size limit within six months. The implementation embodying this agreement was called SegWit2X. This pseudo-compromise was quickly criticized due to the absence of Bitcoin Core developers at the meeting—they simply weren’t invited.\nThe agreement led to SegWit’s activation during summer 2017. In July, miners began massively signaling support. On the 21st, the lock-in process was initiated (rendering the UASF ineffective). SegWit was finally activated on August 24, 2017.\nThe upgrade proceeded smoothly. However, at the same time, another split occurred—this time, fully intentional. In opposition to the UASF, miners decided to activate a new protocol incompatible with the original, which didn’t include SegWit and implemented an 8 MB block size limit: Bitcoin Cash. The protocol’s launch was overseen by Amaury Séchet, a French developer.\nOn August 1, 2017, with block 478,559 mined at 6:12 PM, Bitcoin Cash was born. Following this split, bitcoin holders ended up with equivalent amounts in bitcoins (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH). Those who disapproved of SegWit joined Bitcoin Cash.\nIn August, as SegWit was finally locked in, some small block proponents began opposing the second part of SegWit2X—the doubling of block size—through a communication campaign dubbed “NO2X.” Their argument emphasized the lack of replay protection in this hard fork. SegWit2X was designed as a non-contentious change and therefore didn’t include such measures, which would have significantly burdened the upgrade process for wallets.\nOpposition grew. Bitcoin Core developers refused to endorse the change. Users mobilized to protest, arguing that “the way the agreement was reached goes against Bitcoin’s very essence”37. Faced with this resistance, the companies signing the New York Agreement gradually withdrew.\n37 “We oppose the New York Agreement and the November Bitcoin SegWit2X hard fork,” Change.org, October 15, 2017: https://www.change.org/p/mineurs-et-entreprises-de-l-éco-système-bitcoin-nous-nous-opposons-au-new-york-agreement-et-au-hard-fork-bitcoin-segwit2x-de-novembre.The plan to double the block size limit was ultimately abandoned on November 8, 2017, a week before its scheduled activation. The project’s promoters—Mike Belshe, Wences Casares, Jihan Wu, Jeff Garzik, Peter Smith, and Erik Voorhees—jointly stated:\n“Our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for Bitcoin. While we strongly believe in the need for a larger block size, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback for Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x”38.\n38 Mike Belshe, “[Bitcoin-segwit2x] Segwit2x Final Steps”, November 8, 2017, 16:58:41 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html.This was a significant victory for the small block philosophy, which would henceforth dominate the chain. As for scalability solutions on BTC, the Lightning Network was launched in beta in March 2018. The sidechain concept was also experimented with, with the launch of Rootstock in January 2018 and Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain in September that same year.\nOn the other side, following SegWit2X’s cancellation, many proponents of increased chain capacity turned to other protocols like Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum.\nDespite constant denigration from detractors, Bitcoin Cash’s evolution continued. However, its community gradually fragmented, leading to two major splits: the creation of Bitcoin SV in November 2018 and “eCash” (XEC) in November 2020. The market share of the entire group plummeted accordingly: by November 2023, the combined value of these three cryptocurrencies represented less than 1% of BTC’s value.",

    "section": "The Rise of Alternative Cryptocurrencies",
    "text": "The Rise of Alternative Cryptocurrencies\nBitcoin is a free project based on open-source code that anyone can copy and deploy on a new network. This characteristic is excellent for innovation: anyone can modify the code and use it as the foundation for a new cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s discovery thus opened the door to genuine currency competition on the Internet. However, this freedom also exists for ill-intentioned individuals who can exploit this openness to create dubious projects—from useless cryptocurrencies to outright scams, including open Ponzi schemes. The rise of “alternative cryptocurrencies” (or “altcoins”) emerged from this duality between the honest innovator and the greedy wrongdoer.\nThe first idea of a cryptocurrency distinct from Bitcoin appeared while Satoshi was still active in the community. In November 2010, a discussion about a distributed domain name system (then called BitDNS) began on IRC and the Bitcoin forum. The idea was to associate website identifiers (DNS) with coins created by the protocol, similar to bitcoins in Bitcoin. Because the registry would be public and tamper-resistant, it would improve upon the existing system. Satoshi wasn’t opposed and suggested merged mining with Bitcoin’s chain39. This led to the creation of Namecoin in April 2011, initiated by Vincent Durham.\n39 Satoshi Nakamoto, “Re: BitDNS and Generalizing Bitcoin”, December 9, 2010, 21:02:42 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28696#msg28696.40 Charlie Lee (coblee), “Re: [ANN] Litecoin—a lite version of Bitcoin. Be ready when it launches!”, October 9, 2011, 06:14:28 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47417.msg564414#msg564414.Subsequently, other cryptocurrencies emerged, such as Ixcoin and Tenebrix. Tenebrix was notable for implementing the scrypt proof-of-work algorithm, developed by miner ArtForz and supposedly resistant to GPUs. In October 2011, Litecoin was launched by Charlie Lee as a “lite version of Bitcoin,” with blocks mined four times faster, units four times less scarce, and incorporating the scrypt algorithm. Litecoin aimed to be “silver to Bitcoin’s gold”40.\nIn August 2012, Sunny King and Scott Nadal launched PPCoin, a system introducing the proof-of-stake mechanism, presented as an energy-efficient alternative to proof-of-work in the long term41. Proof-of-stake was integrated in a hybrid manner alongside proof-of-work. PPCoin gradually became known as Peercoin over the years.\n41 Sunny King, “[ANN] [PPC] PPCoin Released!—First Long-Term Energy-Efficient Crypto-Currency”, August 19, 2012, 19:54:28 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=101820.msg1113938#msg1113938; Sunny King, Scott Nadal, “PPCoin: Peer-to-Peer Crypto-Currency with Proof-of-Stake”, August 19, 2012, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20121021014644/http://www.ppcoin.org/static/ppcoin-paper.pdf.In 2013, with the financial enthusiasm resulting from bitcoin’s success, creating original cryptocurrencies became extremely profitable. New protocols multiplied, such as Feathercoin in April, Primecoin in July, and the famous Dogecoin in December. Coinmarketcap.com was launched in May 2013 to list cryptocurrencies and rank them by “market capitalization”—that is, their aggregate value (number of units multiplied by unit price).\nHowever, not everyone appreciated this proliferation, and a movement of rejection formed against what seemed like a harmful fragmentation of the ecosystem. As early as 2011, skepticism towards the first alternative cryptocurrencies was evident, as seen in Hal Finney’s and Gavin Andresen’s reactions. The rejection became more pronounced in August 2013 with Gavin Andresen equating the creation of new cryptocurrencies to inflation42, and Daniel Krawisz, a writer for the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, highlighting the extreme difficulty of surpassing Bitcoin’s network effect43.\n42 Gavin Andresen, The macro-economics of alt-coins, August 19, 2013: https://gavintech.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-macro-economics-of-alt-coins.html.43 Daniel Krawisz, The Problem with Altcoins, August 22, 2013: https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-problem-with-altcoins/.44 Vitalik Buterin, “In Defense of Alternative Cryptocurrencies”, Bitcoin Magazine, September 7, 2013: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/defense-alternative-cryptocurrencies.In parallel, a contrary trend emerged: cryptomonetary pluralism advocating openness and tolerance towards cryptocurrency diversity. This was notably defended by the young Vitalik Buterin in September 201344, who put it into practice by developing his own project, Ethereum.\nFrom 2014 onward, this trend was reinforced by the emergence of fundamentally more relevant crypto-economic systems than mere Bitcoin copies. To address Bitcoin’s lack of privacy, several solutions emerged. Darkcoin, launched in January 2014 (later becoming Dash), was one such example. Monero, a protocol integrating default privacy whose name means “coin” in Esperanto, was launched in April. Additionally, the publication of the Zerocoin and Zerocash protocols by Matthew Green in 2013 led to the creation of Zcash in October 2016.\nBut privacy wasn’t the only area of innovation. Other separate protocols emerged to implement enhancements to Bitcoin’s programmability, aligning with the idea of a “Bitcoin 2.0” spreading within the community. Indeed, Satoshi’s protocol was ill-suited for complex operations and creating secondary digital tokens, even though this was possible on layers like Omni and Counterparty. Thus, new systems appeared, such as Bitshares—a decentralized marketplace notable for its delegated proof-of-stake mechanism—and NXT, a platform featuring a wide range of functionalities. However, the standout system was Ethereum.\nEthereum generalized Bitcoin’s programmability by creating a kind of decentralized world computer operating in parallel on all nodes of a peer-to-peer network. The project originated from Vitalik Buterin’s vision at the end of 2013. Along with seven co-founders, he conducted a token pre-sale in July–August 2014, raising 31,529 bitcoins45 (over $15 million at the time) to fund development. Ethereum was intentionally more progressive, innovative, and flexible than Bitcoin. The chain was officially launched a year later, on July 30, 2015.\n45 The BTC address used by EthSuisse was 36PrZ1KHYMpqSyAQXSG8VwbUiq2EogxLo2.—Vitalik Buterin, Launching the Ether Sale, July 22, 2014: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale.In 2014, the first stablecoin also appeared: Tether USD (USDT), launched on the Bitcoin chain on October 6 under the name Realcoin. This digital token was pegged to the dollar through the guarantee of Tether Limited, which committed to redeem each unit for a real dollar. This “stable” cryptocurrency allowed individuals and exchanges to benefit from the dollar’s low volatility without facing legal inconveniences.\nIn response to this development, the movement rejecting these new projects continued to grow. It was exemplified on October 22, 2014, by Blockstream’s sidechain paper, describing how Bitcoin could serve as the foundation for all use cases, and a complementary article explaining the rationale behind the company’s founding. In the latter, Blockstream developers wrote:\n“The altcoin approach of creating a new cryptocurrency solely to introduce new features creates uncertainty for those observing cryptocurrencies from the outside. There seems to be no natural stopping point, with each copy being potentially copied again, ad infinitum. This creates both market fragmentation and development fragmentation. We believe that for cryptocurrencies to succeed as a whole, we must foster network effect, not fragmentation”46.\n46 Blockstream, Why We Founded Blockstream, October 22, 2014, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20161022162335/https://www.blockstream.com/2014/10/23/why-we-are-co-founders-of-blockstream.html.47 The expression used by Vitalik Buterin was “bitcoin dominance maximalist” (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2is4us/whats_wrong_with_counterparty/cl54c0y/). In his article published on November 19, 2014, he defined Bitcoin maximalism as “the idea that a multi-currency universe is undesirable, that launching ‘yet another coin’ is morally wrong, and that it is both just and inevitable that the Bitcoin currency comes to take a monopoly position in the cryptocurrency scene.”—Vitalik Buterin, On Bitcoin Maximalism, and Currency and Platform Network Effects, November 19, 2014: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/20/bitcoin-maximalism-currency-platform-network-effects/.48 Membership in maximalism is sometimes claimed today by people who don’t embrace its extremist nature (even if it’s inherent in the term). That’s why the pleonasm “toxic maximalism” can be used to describe this tendency. Jameson Lopp also refers to “bitcoin puritanism.” See Jameson Lopp, History of Bitcoin Maximalism, March 25, 2023: https://blog.lopp.net/history-of-bitcoin-maximalism/.Over the years, this rejection gradually became known as Bitcoin maximalism, reappropriating the term used pejoratively by Vitalik Buterin against those who systematically disparaged alternative cryptocurrencies47. The movement advocated maximizing Bitcoin’s economic dominance over close competitors and prescribed its adherents to act accordingly. The aim was to emphasize network effect, not only because it was technically necessary but also because it was morally desirable48.\nHowever, faced with Bitcoin’s limitations highlighted during the block size war, the phenomenon of substitution by other crypto-economic systems intensified over time. From March 2017, BTC’s dominance over other cryptocurrencies dropped from around 85%, where it had held steady, to 40% by June. This was partly due to Ethereum’s rise, which provided a simple way to issue programmable tokens on its blockchain. This functionality enabled fundraising through token pre-sales, known as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), to finance projects involving the tokens. The number of such fundraisers exploded in 2017–2018, leading to the so-called “ICO craze.” The largest, EOS, raised $4.1 billion over a year.\nIn 2019, another enthusiasm emerged: decentralized finance, or DeFi. DeFi aimed to replicate traditional financial system tools in a digital, decentralized, open, and transparent manner. The goal was to minimize intermediation (often imperfectly) in executing various financial operations: exchanges, secured lending, derivatives creation, predictive markets, and so on. This development mainly occurred on Ethereum and was embodied by the rise of the Maker protocol, enabling the existence of the first decentralized stablecoin—the dai. In DeFi, BTC was used as prime collateral. Alongside this, a new trend around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) emerged, gaining mainstream attention from 2021.\nHowever, all these projects suffered from significant technical and human flaws, making criticism still relevant. Many lacked the “decentralization” they claimed. Others were duplicates offering nothing new and disappeared due to the network effect of competitors. Others were outright scams, with promoters lying to sell their tokens. This explains why Bitcoin maximalism persists at the time of writing.",

    "section": "Institutional Integration",
    "text": "Institutional Integration\nThe openness to traditional finance initiated in 2012 gradually translated into integration within the existing legal system. This trend was natural: for Bitcoin to exist, it needed a certain level of tolerance from the public and, ultimately, from authorities that “represent” them.\nInstitutionalization began primarily through regulation—subjecting the sector to a legal framework generally defined and enforced by the state. In practice, this meant subjecting significant financial players to more or less stringent standards. Regulation thus equated to control—something fundamentally opposed by Bitcoin, leading to inherent tension.\nFrom Bitcoin’s early years, intelligence agencies took an interest, both in the U.S. and France. In April 2011, the CIA invited Gavin Andresen to discuss Bitcoin, which he did in June. On May 9, 2012, an internal FBI report on Bitcoin leaked online, stating that “if Bitcoin stabilizes and grows in popularity, it will become an increasingly useful tool for various illegal activities beyond the cyber realm”49. In July 2012, a Tracfin report noted that “virtual currencies” posed a “specific risk in terms of combating money laundering and terrorist financing”50.\n49 Kim Zetter, “FBI Fears Bitcoin’s Popularity with Criminals”, Wired, May 9, 2012: http://www.wired.com/2012/05/fbi-fears-bitcoin/.50 Tracfin, 2011 Activity Report, July 2012: https://www.economie.gouv.fr/files/files/directions_services/tracfin/Publications/rapports_activite/2011_rapport_FR.pdf51 Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies, March 18, 2013: https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf.These investigations paved the way for financial regulations starting in 2013, spurred by the spring price surge. On March 18, FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) published a document clarifying its position on digital currencies51, specifying that exchanges were Money Services Businesses (MSBs) and thus required licenses to operate in the U.S.\nGradually, standards tightened. Exchanges began implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures by requiring identity verification to access their services. They could also go further under Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations.\nOther financial regulations applied to cryptocurrencies, such as capital gains taxation. In France, for example, users are legally required to declare capital gains from the “sale of digital assets for valuable consideration” and pay a 30% tax if total sales exceed €305 annually52.\n52 French General Tax Code, Article 150 VH bis, May 24, 2019.Regulations differed between jurisdictions. While some were lenient, others were much stricter. For example, New York State enacted ultra-restrictive regulations in 2015, requiring many ecosystem players to obtain a “BitLicense.” Similarly, France issued a decree in November 2019 subjecting Digital Asset Service Providers (DASPs) to stringent conditions. In both cases, local actors fled to more accommodating jurisdictions.\nBeyond regulation, traditional players’ discourse was initially openly hostile to Bitcoin’s original conception. This was evident in 2014–2015 with the emergence of the term “blockchain technology,” aiming to deny the rebellious aspect of the cryptocurrency by amalgamating all distributed consensus techniques under one label. The call for blockchain was popularized in 2015 by Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase trader known for creating credit default swaps (CDS), which were at the root of the subprime mortgage crisis53. However, over time, the discourse softened.\n53 Edward Robinson, Matthew Leising, “Blythe Masters Tells Banks the Blockchain Changes Everything”, Bloomberg, September 1, 2015: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-09-01/blythe-masters-tells-banks-the-blockchain-changes-everything.Regulation introduced new constraints, in direct opposition to Bitcoin’s intrinsic permissionless nature. But it gradually allowed larger investors, like investment funds, to enter the market with liquidity, legitimizing the cryptocurrency in the eyes of the general public, who often required official approval to take interest. This prompted some community members to seek cooperation with regulators.\nIn 2017, a new speculative frenzy emerged, with bitcoin’s price sharply rising from $1,000 in January to $20,000 in December. This new bubble again attracted media attention. Bitcoin was now taken much more seriously. In December 2017, it even entered the Chicago Mercantile Exchange through futures contracts—a notable advancement.\nAfter the block size war, BTC was increasingly seen strictly as digital gold—an asset uncorrelated with other financial markets that could serve as a safe haven. Some analysts even began considering crypto-assets as a new asset class. For a growing number of users, bitcoin was perceived as a store of value that could serve as a benchmark for the global monetary system and integrate into the legal systems of various state entities.\nThis shift in perception caused a growing conflict between those who viewed bitcoin as an intermediary for black-market transactions and those who saw it as a reserve currency. One side, proponents of Bitcoin’s free and permissionless aspect, categorically rejected any regulation, viewing it as compromising the project’s original values. The other side, proponents of the reserve currency concept, realized that cooperating with authorities was necessary for the wealthiest entities (investment funds, large companies, states) to buy in. To achieve this, they bet on interest representation (lobbying) and geopolitical context (diplomacy).\nIn 2020, the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated developments. Western states imposed strict lockdowns, paralyzing their economies and triggering the start of a deflationary crisis. Central banks reacted accordingly by injecting record liquidity. As in 2008, the goal was to save the economy by creating money and injecting it into the market: $2.3 trillion were issued in the U.S. and €1.85 trillion in the European Union54. Additionally, key interest rates were lowered to near zero to stimulate lending, further increasing the available scriptural money supply.\n54 In the U.S., the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), signed in March 2020, accounted for this additional expenditure. It was a Treasury Department program, but we can assume it was primarily funded by “borrowing” from the Federal Reserve. On the European Central Bank side, liquidity injections were implemented through the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), which planned €750 billion in March 2020, plus €600 billion in June, and an additional €500 billion in December.Due to this massive monetary creation, the threat of high inflation reappeared in the West, having been absent for decades. This risk prompted people to buy bitcoin, which, as an asset independent of monetary creation, made perfect sense. Notably, large publicly traded U.S. companies with significant dollar reserves joined in. On August 11, 2020, MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, announced adopting bitcoin as its primary reserve asset, acquiring 21,454 BTC for a total purchase price of $250 million. In October, Square—an American mobile payment company co-founded by Jack Dorsey—followed suit, acquiring 4,709 bitcoins. In February 2021, electric car maker Tesla, led by Elon Musk, announced purchasing nearly 43,000 BTC for $1.5 billion.\nConsequently, a new speculative surge occurred, and bitcoin’s price soared again. Hovering around $10,000 since 2019, it rose rapidly in fall 2020, surpassing its previous high in December and reaching $64,000 in April 2021.\n\n\n\nBTC price evolution between July 19, 2010, and November 30, 2023 (source: buybitcoinworldwide.com).\n\n\nBut this trend extended beyond companies, catching the attention of a small Central American state: El Salvador. The price growth attracted President Nayib Bukele, who decided to make bitcoin legal tender in his country alongside the U.S. dollar. The president was inspired by Jack Mallers, Strike’s energetic CEO, and the experience of Bitcoin Beach—a project to develop a sustainable bitcoin-based economy around El Zonte Beach, south of the capital, San Salvador.\nThe legal tender mandate was announced by Bukele on June 5, 2021, in a video broadcast during the Bitcoin Miami 2021 conference and implemented on September 7. Notably, the measure required merchants to accept bitcoin as a means of payment and debt settlement, though exceptions existed and the law wasn’t strictly enforced.\nUsing Bitcoin theoretically offered many benefits for the population: ensuring receipt of funds transferred from abroad, fostering a culture of saving, attracting capital, making the country more appealing (especially for tourism), providing international opportunities, and creating new hope in a society plagued by poverty, crime, and corruption. Additionally, adopting bitcoin allowed the country, which exclusively relied on the dollar since abandoning the colón in 2001, to partially escape the U.S. Federal Reserve’s seigniorage by accumulating bitcoin in its foreign exchange reserves. El Salvador’s central bank acquired a few hundred bitcoins when the legal tender status took effect.\nThis event was applauded by many bitcoiners who saw a tremendous opportunity and visited the country in the following months. Among other things, it further solidified bitcoin’s institutional legitimacy as a currency protected by a state. This coincided with the peak of the speculative episode, pushing bitcoin’s price to $69,000 in November 2021.\nHowever, opinions weren’t unanimous, and numerous criticisms arose concerning the president’s authoritarian practices, the implementation of Lightning (via the Chivo app), and the legal tender imposition itself, which contradicted Bitcoin’s philosophy. As subsequent events showed, El Salvador’s experiment was mixed: adoption was far from successful, the population remained wary, and the price drop (a threefold decrease within a year) discouraged medium-term saving.\nOverall, Bitcoin nevertheless gained undeniable legitimacy over the years55, prompting its adversaries to leverage its success for their own projects.\n55 A more recent illustration of this institutional integration is the approval of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) linked to bitcoin in the United States on January 10, 2024. (Note from January 2025.)This was the case with major companies through the Libra initiative, led by Facebook and announced on June 18, 2019. It was a project for a digital currency backed by a basket of currencies and other assets, managed by a consortium of about a hundred companies from traditional finance (like Visa, Mastercard, or PayPal), the cryptocurrency sphere (like Coinbase or Xapo), or the tech sector in general (like Iliad).\nThe announcement provoked a backlash from both the public, concerned about potential surveillance capabilities, and states, fearing loss of monetary sovereignty. Naturally, the project was opposed by regulators worldwide, starting with the U.S. Congress. In December 2020, Libra was renamed Diem, becoming a dollar-backed stablecoin project. It was ultimately abandoned in January 2022.\nState entities also organized by considering deploying their own electronic currencies, managing issuance and transactions. During this period, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) began developing. Inspired directly by Bitcoin’s success and stablecoins, the idea aimed to modernize traditional fiat currencies, promoting transaction fluidity and financial inclusion.\nSuch a currency would perpetuate digital transfers, which already constituted most transactions in Western countries. But it would also offer authorities an additional control lever, introducing an unprecedented danger: generalized banking surveillance and censorship. Coupled with a controlled disappearance of cash, such a currency could form the basis of a dystopian, totalitarian regime.\nCBDC projects thus highlighted Bitcoin’s essential contribution: a censorship-resistant tool enabling freedom in an unfree world. The concept discovered by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2007, already very useful, could become the solution to a problem only beginning to emerge.",

    "text": "A Deployment Marked by Divisions\nBitcoin has evolved since its early developments on Mt. Gox and Silk Road. Throughout its existence, it has been the source of numerous internal divisions concerning the vision it should embody. These divisions led to conflicts that profoundly marked the cryptocurrency’s history.\nFirst, the entry of financial actors into the ecosystem emphasized bitcoin’s resistance to inflation (21 million cap) and its deflationary nature, at the expense of its censorship resistance, creating a principled opposition between new investors and early cypherpunks. Then, the block size war divided the community from 2015 over the blockchain’s role—between proponents of a payment protocol and defenders of a settlement protocol. Next, the emergence of alternative cryptocurrencies (notably Ethereum) sparked pluralistic enthusiasm, but dubious practices accompanying new project launches gave rise to a rejection movement: Bitcoin maximalism. Finally, a last opposition occurred over institutional assimilation—between those willing to cooperate with authorities and regulators and those advocating confrontation, denouncing submission and compliance.\nBitcoin today is multifaceted and still grapples with these tensions to varying degrees. But it’s precisely these tensions that have allowed it to become the organic and antifragile system that has carved out a place in our society. Satoshi Nakamoto’s discovery remains alive and continues, block after block, to serve its users.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "What Is Money?\nMoney is a complex subject to comprehend, and people’s understanding of it is often vague and inaccurate. Yet, it is a tool used extensively in our modern societies, characterized by commercialization and the division of labor. Thus, it’s crucial to grasp this concept in a nuanced and relevant way.\nThe tangible importance of money is reflected in the variety of terms used to refer to it in French. Firstly, the most common term for money is argent (silver), so much so that today one must specify when referring to the precious metal itself. Slang abounds with diverse terms: le blé (wheat), referencing the cereal; l’oseille (sorrel), originally a garden herb; le flouze, derived from an Arabic word meaning copper coin; le pèze, possibly from Breton; le pognon, implying money passed hand to hand; la maille and le sou, names of old coins. For its liquid form, terms like numéraire or espèces are used, or cash, an Anglicism stemming from the Old French casse, which led to caisse (cash register). Finally, there’s the word monnaie itself, originating from the Latin moneta, derived from the name of the temple of Juno Moneta (“Juno the Advisor”) where Rome’s currency was minted.\nMoney is a generally accepted medium of exchange within a given group of people. It’s a tool used in the indirect exchange of goods and services: a person sells goods and services for money, which then serves to buy other goods and services.\nMoney solves the problem of the double coincidence of wants that arises in a barter economy, where two people must simultaneously desire each other’s goods in the desired proportion for a direct exchange to occur. For example, if a baker wants to acquire a piece of meat in exchange for some of his baguettes, he must find a butcher who wants those baguettes at that time, place, and quantity. Money acts as an intermediate good that people obtain with the intent to exchange it for something else, greatly facilitating their transactions.\nWhat makes one good serve as money over another is its saleability1, meaning the ease with which it can be exchanged on the market whenever the holder desires, with minimal loss of value. The good serving as money must be readily obtainable without causing a shortage of money. This property is similar to the liquidity of a market, representing the ability to buy or sell goods there quickly without significantly affecting prices. In this sense, money is sometimes described as the most liquid good within a given economy, and terms like liquid assets are used to refer to physical money consisting of coins and banknotes, which can be exchanged easily and without constraint.\nMoney isn’t a concept with fixed and rigid boundaries. A good can be more or less a currency depending on its level of saleability within the group where it’s exchanged, allowing us to speak of degrees of moneyness or liquidity2. Gold and bitcoin, for instance, have a lesser degree of moneyness than state-issued currencies in general, but that doesn’t prevent them from being considered currencies in a broad sense. Gold is even globally perceived as the quintessential store of value and the historical foundation of money, which is reflected in culture and particularly in video games.\nMoreover, a good’s saleability can vary depending on the situation. The dollar isn’t necessarily useful in Europe, where the euro is much more saleable. Gold isn’t ideal for daily transactions but serves well for transferring value over time. Bitcoin is seldom used in physical commerce but more so on the Internet. Cigarettes aren’t used as currency among the general population but have served that purpose in certain prisons. A good’s status as money also depends on context.\nThe high saleability necessary for a good to be selected as money is reflected in the three classic functions of money, often cited by economists and attributed to the philosopher Aristotle. These functions are:\nIn other words, money must have saleability that adapts across space, time, and scale.\nFrom these three fundamental functions, we derive the essential qualities of money:\nThese qualities have been present, to varying degrees, in different forms of money that have emerged and established themselves throughout history.",

    "text": "1 The concept of saleability was described in 1892 by Austrian economist Carl Menger in his essay On the Origin of Money. The German term is Absatzfähigkeit, referring to a commodity’s ability to be easily sold or to sell well. It has been translated into English as saleability and marketability. In French, it can also be translated as vendabilité or échangeabilité.2 Economist Fritz Machlup spoke of “degrees of moneyness” regarding dollar-denominated claims in the European banking system (Fritz Machlup, “Euro-dollar creation: a mystery story”, in Banca Nazionale del Lavoro Quarterly Review, vol. 23, no. 94, 1970, p. 225). Similarly, Hayek wrote in Denationalisation of Money in 1976 (p. 93): “This also means that, although we usually assume there is a clear distinction between what is money and what is not—and legislation generally tries to establish such a demarcation—this dichotomy does not exist when we consider the properties that confer on a good the quality of money. What we observe is rather a continuum in which goods endowed with different degrees of liquidity, or whose values fluctuate independently of each other, partially overlap in the degree to which they can be used as money.”\n\n\n\nMedium of exchange: Allows for the settlement of exchanges directly or over time (credit).\nStore of value: Enables the saving of wealth for future use.\nUnit of account: Serves as a standard means of expressing the value of other goods, in the form of prices.\n\n\n\n\nPortability: Money must be easily transportable to be transferred from one person to another; the cost of moving it should be minimal.\nDurability: It should be preservable over time, not deteriorate or spoil.\nScarcity: Its availability must be restricted and not subject to sudden changes.\nDivisibility: It should be divisible into smaller units.\nFungibility: Each unit must be interchangeable with another.\nVerifiability: The authenticity of money must be easily and quickly verifiable (coins must be “sound and ring true”).\nCensorship resistance: It should be difficult to prevent a transaction from occurring (this can be challenged in digital solutions).\nHistoricity: Money should have a longstanding use (thus benefiting from the Lindy effect3).\n\n3 The Lindy effect is the idea that the future life expectancy of a non-perishable entity, such as a technology or an idea, is proportional to its current age.",

    "section": "The Different Forms of Money",
    "text": "The Different Forms of Money\nMonies throughout history can be grouped into different categories. Five somewhat distinct forms stand out: commodity money, representative money, paper money, credit money, and digital money. Each form possesses unique qualities resulting from the evolution of monetary systems worldwide.\nCommodity money is, as the name suggests, a commodity that comes to serve as a medium of exchange within a particular group. In the context we use here4, a commodity is a standardized, essential, and common product with qualities perfectly defined and known to buyers, such as a mineral material, an agricultural product, or a manufactured item. Thus, the good used as money originally has inherent utility beyond its monetary function—industrial, nutritional, or aesthetic.\n4 This is the sense given to the word commodity in English.5 The word “salary” comes from the Latin salarium, which originally referred to the “salt ration,” then to the “pay to buy salt” given to Roman soldiers in antiquity: https://www.lexilogos.com/latin/gaffiot.php?q=salarium.Throughout human history, various commodities have been used as mediums of exchange. People have used animal remnants like shells and bones, handcrafted items like cloths or knives, foodstuffs like wheat, spices, cacao beans, or salt5, livestock products including large cattle, and natural materials like stones or metals.\nAll these commodities possessed monetary qualities to varying extents, but some had significant flaws making them less suitable as mediums of exchange. Livestock had poor portability and wasn’t divisible. Cereals like wheat or rice weren’t very durable. The scarcity of shells could be high inland but low near coasts. Handcrafted items and jewelry varied slightly from one another, harming their fungibility.\nGenerally, precious metals—especially gold, silver, and copper (in the form of bronze)—were selected over time to become the global monetary base. This convergence can be explained by the fact that these three metals (with chemical symbols Au, Ag, and Cu, respectively) all belong to group 11 of the periodic table and share similar chemical properties, including great resistance to corrosion and oxidation, and high malleability. The use of multiple metals can be attributed to their imperfect portability: gold allows for transporting significant value but isn’t suitable for small daily transactions, unlike silver and copper.\nPrecious metals could be used in their raw state, as ingots of varying sizes. However, they were especially minted into coins, upon which a trusted institution (usually a state) would inscribe its mark, certifying the weight and metal content. This inscription served, among other things, as a certificate embedded in the money, intended to facilitate exchange by eliminating the need for verification with each payment.\nThis certification can also be detached from the money, leading to representative money. Representative money consists of certificates, printed or digital, redeemable on demand for a base commodity, like gold or silver, from a trusted third party. Crucially, such money is theoretically backed by a full reserve of base money held by one or more institutions. These certificates are essentially money substitutes—legally enforceable claims on a debtor for a specified amount of base money.\nThe archetype of representative money is the classical gold standard system, prevalent during the Belle Époque in the Western world, where money consisted of gold coins and banknotes convertible into gold. Over time, however, convertibility was gradually abandoned, and banknotes transformed into mere fiat paper money.\nFiat money is money whose use value is negligible compared to its nominal value. Its initial value comes from the trust (fiducia in Latin) placed in other actors rather than its intrinsic properties, as with commodity money. This trust can be vested in a state, a corporation, or a community. It’s based not only on the belief that the custodian won’t degrade its properties (including scarcity) but also, in the state’s case, on the assurance that it will enforce its use through authority, hence the term fiat (from Latin, meaning “let it be done”). Unlike representative money, fiat money doesn’t represent a commodity or another base money—it is the base money.\nA typical example of fiat money is paper money, based on a physical medium whose use value is significantly less than the nominal or face value indicated. The medium can be made of paper, cloth, or plastic (banknotes) or metal alloys composed of copper, zinc, and nickel (coins). Maintaining its value is ensured by limiting production and suppressing counterfeiting; otherwise, the money would become commodity money, and its exchange value would rapidly approach its production cost, generally lower than its nominal value.\nStates have experimented with this form of money multiple times throughout history, often leading to dramatic inflations, as illustrated by the Song dynasty’s attempt between the 11th and 12th centuries in China or the episode of the assignats during the French Revolution. It’s only since the 20th century and the abandonment of the gold standard that this model has become widespread.\nCredit money, also called scriptural money, relates to the writing (scriptura in Latin) of a debt in a bank’s ledger. It differs from representative money in that it doesn’t oblige the custodian to hold the represented good in reserve. Banks are credit organizations, not money warehouses: when someone “deposits” funds into a bank account, they’re effectively lending money to the bank, which “credits” their account accordingly (hence the adage “deposits make loans”).\nLike representative money, credit money is a money substitute. It must be based on a base unit of account, derived from commodity money (like gold) or fiat money (like the dollar), used to settle the debt upon maturity.\nToday, credit is widely monetized in Western societies, as evidenced by modern payment methods such as checks, transfers, and bank cards. Scriptural money composes more than 90% of the broad money supply in circulation.\nDigital money is a particular form of fiat money whose existence relies on an electronically managed ledger. It differs from scriptural money in that the ledger entry isn’t a claim on a third party but is the money itself. The money is stored on electronic memory, hence the term electronic money6. Due to its nature, this form of money is generally programmable, meaning spending conditions can be inscribed in the supporting computer system.\n6 Legally, electronic money refers to a specific type of scriptural money. Article L315-1 of the Code monétaire et financier defines it as “a monetary value stored in electronic form, including magnetic, representing a claim on the issuer, issued against the remittance of funds for payment transactions defined in Article L. 133-3, and accepted by a natural or legal person other than the issuer.” Therefore, we prefer to use the term digital money here.The first example of digital money is that managed centrally by a central bank. Along with coins and banknotes, it constitutes the monetary base, also called “central bank money” or “central money.” Specifically, it comprises the monetary assets held by account holders with the central bank (i.e., commercial banks). This type of money allowed dependence on physical media—which made settlement difficult and risky—to be reduced. In the future, state digital money is expected to expand to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) available to financial institutions and possibly individuals.\nThe second example is cryptocurrency, managed in a decentralized manner by a peer-to-peer network, with bitcoin being the archetype. It’s a market-based digital money in that its existence doesn’t depend on state intervention (or lack thereof). This is the form of money on which this work focuses.",

    "section": "The Austrian School and the Value of Money",
    "text": "The Austrian School and the Value of Money\nSince Bitcoin is a monetary system, understanding its functioning and implications requires knowledge of economics. While there are multiple ways to approach the subject, we’ll adopt the perspective of the “Austrian” economic school, which is probably the most relevant for describing Bitcoin, as it inspired, at least indirectly, its creation and development.\nThe Austrian School of economics, also known as the Vienna School, is an economic thought tradition founded in Austria in the 19th century around Carl Menger. It initially developed in this Central European country with thinkers like Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Friedrich von Wieser. After World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918, it spread abroad, notably to the United States, with economists of Austrian origin like Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek (the latter receiving the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974). Subsequently, it expanded to include thinkers of various backgrounds, with main figures like Murray Rothbard, Jesús Huerta de Soto, and Hans-Hermann Hoppe.\nThe Austrian School is characterized by its methodological approach—methodological individualism—based on praxeology, the rational study of human action. This method is aprioristic (or axiomatic), relying on certain axioms related to human behavior. It begins with the individual to deduce logical consequences for the whole economy. Thus, the Austrian School opposes economic thought schools that mainly rely on observation and seek to model the economy “mathematically,” such as the predominantly neo-Keynesian schools today.\nNotably, the Austrian School provides a nuanced analysis of value—the interest or importance an individual places on something.\nVarious conceptions of the origin of value exist. Some believe value comes from land and related activities, a thesis defended by 18th-century physiocratic economists. Others postulate that value originates from labor, like Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and especially Karl Marx, whose supporters have upheld this theory since the 19th century.\nThe Austrian School differs by advocating a subjective conception of value. For Austrians, value isn’t an objective phenomenon but depends on individual perspective. According to Carl Menger:\n“Value is not inherent in goods, it is not a property of them; it is not a thing existing by itself. It is the judgment economizing men make about the importance of the goods at their disposal for the maintenance of their lives and well-being. Hence, value does not exist outside the consciousness of men.”7\n7 Carl Menger, Principles of Economics, Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2007, pp. 120–121: https://cdn.mises.org/principles_of_economics.pdf.Thus, one individual might assign immense value to a good (like a painting), while another might attach none. Similarly, the value attributed can vary based on context: someone living in a desert won’t view a liter of water the same way as someone in a humid region.\nAn individual’s prior consumption can also affect the value of the same good. If someone is starving, they’ll place great value on an apple; but as they become satiated, the value they assign to subsequent apples decreases. This concept is known as marginal utility.\nEconomists refer to the value an individual derives from a good as use value. The meaning of this term varies depending on who uses it. Often, it refers to objective use value—the relationship between an object and the effect it can produce, like the heating power of wood. But in the Austrian context, it can also refer to subjective use value, which isn’t always based on an objective evaluation criterion.\nAssessing the value of goods and services allows individuals to determine how to direct their production and consumption. This valuation also plays a role in commerce: an exchange occurs only if both parties assign greater value to the good held by the other. Thus, if a good belonging to someone else is worth more to me than four silver coins, and that person values two silver coins more than the good, an exchange at a price of three silver coins would benefit us both. This is why, in the long run, the free market creates wealth. The price obtained in commerce is sometimes called exchange value.\nEven though value is subjective, this doesn’t prevent people from assigning value to the same things. First, being similar, they naturally value goods that satisfy their primary physiological needs (drinking water, food, clothing, shelter, etc.). Second, they tend to mimic others’ desires for non-essential items, aligning with the mimetic nature of desire, leading to fads and trends around common objects. Finally, they assign value to higher-order goods, such as tools (capital) or raw materials, used to produce the desired consumer goods.\nMoney is a special case in value analysis. It rests on an intersubjective phenomenon—a psychological construct within each person that strengthens as it becomes ingrained in others’ minds. People acquire money because they believe they can later exchange it for other goods, reinforcing others’ belief in its utility. This creates a virtuous cycle consistent with the network effect.\nAs a result, even though value is subjectively assessed, the value of money necessarily converges toward a common objective exchange value, known as purchasing power. This purchasing power can vary over time and location, influenced by natural market fluctuations and distortions caused by the state. When it decreases persistently (manifested by a general rise in prices), it’s called inflation. When it increases persistently (resulting in a general price decline), it’s called deflation.\nWithin the valuation of the good used as money, we can distinguish two mutually exclusive values: its non-monetary value—the nutritional, industrial, aesthetic, etc., utility derived by the person—and its strictly monetary value, stemming from the advantage of using the good as a medium of exchange. For commodity monies, for example, we can differentiate between intrinsic demand and monetary demand: gold’s value doesn’t solely come from aesthetic demand (jewelry) and industrial demand (microprocessors) but also, and primarily, from its demand as a medium of exchange, notably from central banks.\nAustrian economists minimize the state’s role in creating money, positing that it largely emerged from economic exchange—at least concerning its most primitive form. They oppose chartalists and proponents of modern monetary theory, who assert that money originated from state intervention and derives its value from being used to pay taxes8. As Carl Menger wrote:\n8 Chartalism (from Latin charta, meaning “paper” or “ticket”) is a monetary theory developed by German economist Georg Friedrich Knapp in 1905 in his work Staatliche Theorie des Geldes. Modern monetary theory is a form of neo-chartalism.9 Carl Menger, Principles of Economics, Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2007, pp. 261–262.“The origin of money (which must be distinguished from coins, which are merely a variety) is […] entirely natural, and thus only under very rare circumstances the result of the state’s influence. Money is neither an invention of the state nor the product of a legislative act, and the sanction of such an act by the state’s authority is therefore foreign to the very concept of money.”9\nFrom this perspective, money originated from exchanges between groups of individuals who didn’t trust each other but wanted to cooperate. Thus, proto-moneys (or paleo-moneys) emerged not within human tribes—whose internal functioning largely relied on gift and credit—but between these tribes. This could involve simple exchange of goods, conflict resolution, marriage arrangements, and payment of tributes10.\n10 Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins of Money, 2002; George Selgin, The Myth of the Myth of Barter, 2016: https://www.alt-m.org/2016/03/15/myth-myth-barter/.With the gradual globalization of the planet, proto-moneys underwent selection: many disappeared in favor of those satisfying the properties of good money. Specifically, the chosen good needed to be easy to hide (censorship resistance), difficult to produce (scarcity), and its value easily estimable (verifiability). Money converged toward coins made of precious metals, most often gold and silver, preferably minted by a recognized authority. The first minted coins likely appeared in the 7th century BCE in Asia Minor under the Lydians, made of electrum—a natural alloy of gold and silver. Subsequently, numerous coins succeeded one another: the Persian daric, the Greek drachma, the Roman denarius, the Byzantine solidus (bezant), and others.\nThe use of coins persisted for centuries and became widespread globally. However, this usage gradually declined from the Renaissance with the emergence of banknotes, which became prevalent during the 19th century due to state actions. The transition to fiat paper money occurred in the 20th century with the total abandonment of any reference to precious metals in the monetary system in 1971. We’ve witnessed a genuine corruption of money, which brought some benefits but mainly allowed authorities to profit further from monetary creation through the infamous “printing press.”\nFor proponents of liberty, it’s crucial to redeem money11 by returning to what Austrian economists call sound money. Sound money is money freely chosen by the market and shielded from coercive interference. As Ludwig von Mises wrote in his The Theory of Money and Credit in 1912:\n11 Bitcoin and Bible Group, Thank God for Bitcoin: The Creation, Corruption and Redemption of Money, Whispering Candle, 2020.12 Ludwig von Mises, The Theory of Money and Credit, Yale University Press, 1953, p. 414: https://cdn.mises.org/Theory%20of%20Money%20and%20Credit.pdf.“The principle of sound money has two aspects. It is positive in that it approves the market’s choice of a commonly used medium of exchange. It is negative in that it obstructs the government’s propensity to meddle with the monetary system.”12\nSeveral political projects have emerged aiming to restore a global monetary system based on sound money. The first was Mises’s (and Rothbard’s) plan to reinstate the gold standard. For Mises, “sound money means a metallic standard,” and the gold standard “makes the determination of the purchasing power of the monetary unit independent of governments and political parties.”\nThe second project was Friedrich Hayek’s, developed later, advocating for currency competition (representative or fiat) issued by private banks13. This inspired the free banking model, where financial institutions could operate freely without intervention from a central bank or other authority—a model notably supported by economists Lawrence White, George Selgin, and Kevin Dowd.\n13 Friedrich Hayek, Denationalisation of Money, The Institute of Economic Affairs, 1976.Neither of these political projects ever materialized, despite decades of events demonstrating the validity of Austrian theories. History shows that state control over money has gradually expanded to become what it is today—a control tending toward totalitarianism. However, there’s an alternative—a solution not political but economic: Bitcoin.",

    "section": "A New Form of Money",
    "text": "A New Form of Money\nBitcoin garners much attention because it introduces something new—not only technically but especially economically. Satoshi Nakamoto’s discovery of this system in 2008 represents a significant upheaval in the monetary realm. Bitcoin constitutes an unprecedented form of money: a sui generis currency (to use Jacques Favier’s expression), of its own kind, challenging existing classifications.\nFirstly, as mentioned, it’s an entirely digital currency. Bitcoin relies on a public ledger of ownership (the blockchain) that defines the currency: entries in this ledger don’t correspond to claims, as with credit money, but are the money itself.\nSecondly, this digital currency innovates by eliminating the need for a trusted third party. The ledger’s content doesn’t depend on a financial institution like a central bank but on a network of actors operating through a distributed computer network.\nThirdly, its security is assured economically: it doesn’t rely on altruistic volunteerism (though that plays a role) but on the economic incentives of the actors involved. This grants the system long-term stability absent in previous private currencies.\nThese properties enable bitcoin to function as distributed fiat money, in that it lacks significant non-monetary uses and derives its value from trust placed in an economy of merchants rather than a third party. It can also be described as network money (from Latin reticulum, meaning “small net” or “network”) since trust is distributed across the network of merchant nodes rather than concentrated on a central server.\nAlthough bitcoin shares characteristics with commodity monies14, it isn’t a commodity. Its properties emerge from an agreement among its users, not from intrinsic physical world characteristics like gold or silver. It’s possible to modify the system’s consensus rules, though such changes are challenging.\n14 “There is […] no one acting as a central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the number of users grows. […] In this sense, it is a system that behaves more like a precious metal.”—Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency, February 18, 2009, https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008:Comment:9562.In reality, money is always an agreement regarding a mutually acceptable intermediary in trade. With commodity money, this agreement naturally converges toward a commodity already exchanged in society. With fiat money, the agreement is maintained by a state decree respected by the population. In Bitcoin’s case, coordination is voluntarily achieved around specific consensus rules.\nThe extent of this agreement gives the currency its strength through the network effect: its utility increases superlinearly relative to the size of the economy using it. This makes it difficult for one currency to be replaced by another and also complicates altering the system’s consensus rules, as we’ll see in Chapter 11 on protocol determination.\nThe primary advantage of commodity money isn’t its intrinsic value but the unforgeable cost required for its production, preventing excessive monetary creation from destroying its purchasing power. In fiat money—whether state or private—the money’s determination lies entirely in the issuer’s hands, who might exploit the situation by creating more units for personal gain, especially if legally privileged.\nBitcoin is different and isn’t subject to this risk: its distributed functioning spreads determination across the economy, preventing it from being subject to a third party’s arbitrary decisions. This uniqueness grants it an unprecedented characteristic: absolute scarcity, resulting from a fixed quantity of units issued according to a predefined schedule. This factor has contributed to its renown: the fact that the money supply is limited to 21 million bitcoins.\nThus, “intrinsic value” isn’t essential for money’s quality. Bitcoin, a pure form of money valued almost exclusively for its monetary role, proves this. For commodity monies, physical properties served as safeguards against private and state interventions; in Bitcoin, the network fulfills this function.",

    "section": "Bitcoin and the Regression Theorem",
    "text": "Bitcoin and the Regression Theorem\nSome Austrian economists refuse to accept that bitcoin could have emerged without an objective use value. They reference Ludwig von Mises’s regression theorem, which states that a currency’s exchange value is calculated based on its previous value and must, by regression, trace back to its value as a commodity.\nThe core of this theorem is found in The Theory of Money and Credit, published in 1912, where Mises writes:\n*“The theory of money’s value as such can only trace the objective exchange value back to the point where it ceases to be money’s value and becomes solely the value of a commodity. At that point, the theory must leave further investigation to the general theory of value, which then has no difficulty solving the problem. It’s true that money’s subjective valuation presupposes an existing objective exchange value, but the value that needs presupposing isn’t the same as the value that needs explaining. What is presupposed is yesterday’s exchange value, and it’s perfectly legitimate to use it to explain today’s. Money’s objective exchange value established on today’s market derives from yesterday’s under the influence of individuals’ subjective valuations in the market, just as yesterday’s derived in turn from the day-before-yesterday’s.\nIf we continually regress in this way, we must arrive at a point where we find no further component in the objective exchange value arising from valuations based on money’s function as a common medium of exchange; a point where money’s value is nothing other than the value of the object useful in another way than as money.”*15\n15 Ludwig von Mises, The Theory of Money and Credit, Yale University Press, 1953, pp. 120–121.The theorem involves two elements: regression and initial valuation.\nRegarding regression, the reasoning holds: the value assigned to money is based on its previous value, allowing us to trace back to an entirely non-monetary value. This initial value doesn’t need to persist; once money is established, its valuation can rely solely on the memory of past prices.\nHistorically, this regression is evident. The value of our current fiat banknotes in the West can be traced back step by step to the value of banknotes as gold certificates, stemming from the value of coins, which in turn comes from gold’s raw value. Gold was initially valued for ornamental and religious reasons before serving as a medium of exchange.\nRegarding initial valuation, Mises’s assertion is less accurate. He speaks of a “commodity” (Ware in German, commodity in English) initially valued for its “industrial” utility, a standardized and common product with defined and known qualities. Elsewhere, he explicitly opposes the Lockean theory of money’s origin, which, in his words, derives “the origin of money from a general agreement attributing fictitious values to intrinsically valueless things.” Mises seems to exclude the possibility of an intangible good without objective use value becoming a medium of exchange without being backed by previous money.\nYet this is precisely what happened with bitcoin, whose success serves as a clear counterexample to the regression theorem in its strictest sense. Mises’s error seems rooted in his bias toward precious metals, linked to the period he was writing in—the early 20th century. Imagining a monetary system as unconventional as Bitcoin was difficult decades before the technological revolution of personal computers and the Internet. As Satoshi Nakamoto explained in August 2010:\n“I think the traditional qualifications for money were described assuming that there were so many rare items competing in the world that an item with an intrinsic value start-up advantage would surely win out over those without intrinsic value. But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, if there were only rare items without intrinsic value, I think people would still take something.”16\n16 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin does NOT violate Mises’ Regression Theorem, August 27, 2010, 17:32:07 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583.msg11405#msg11405.17 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin does NOT violate Mises’ Regression Theorem, August 27, 2010, 17:32:07 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583.msg11405#msg11405.Despite this misconception, the regression theorem remains valid in a broader sense. For any money to serve as a medium of exchange, it must have initially possessed a non-monetary use value. Consequently, someone had to assign value to bitcoin “for one reason or another”17 before it could be used monetarily, such as to “transfer wealth over a long distance.”\nThere was, therefore, a bootstrapping problem. Cryptographer Hal Finney, who had experimented with digital cash systems in the early 1990s, was notably aware of this. In Bitcoin’s early days in January 2009, he wrote:\n“One immediate problem with any new currency is how to value it. Even ignoring the practical issue that almost no one will accept it at first, it’s still hard to find a convincing argument for assigning it a non-zero value.”18\n18 Hal Finney, Re: Bitcoin v0.1 released, January 11, 2009, 01:22:01 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html.But this bootstrapping eventually occurred.",

    "text": "The Emergence of Bitcoin’s Value\nAccording to the regression theorem, bitcoin must have possessed a non-monetary use value (objective or subjective) before being valued as a medium of exchange. Over the years, various initial valuation hypotheses have been proposed to explain the emergence of bitcoin’s market value. Let’s examine the main ones, starting with the least plausible and concluding with the most likely.\nFirstly, an unfortunately common hypothesis is that bitcoin’s value derives from the energy used in its production. This idea originates from NewLibertyStandard’s estimation, who, starting in October 2009, bought and sold bitcoins at a rate based on his personal production’s energy cost. Essentially, this is a revisited version of the Marxist labor theory of value. Satoshi Nakamoto criticized this explanation in February 2010, stating that production cost is a consequence of price, not a cause:\n“In the absence of a market to establish a price, NewLibertyStandard’s estimation based on production cost is a good guess and a useful service (thank you). The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost. If the price is below cost, production slows down. If the price is above cost, profit can be made by producing and selling more. At the same time, increased production would raise the difficulty, pushing the production cost toward the price.”19\n19 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Current Bitcoin economic model is unsustainable, February 21, 2010, 05:44:24 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.msg415#msg415. He reiterated this objection in July 2010: “It [the currency] isn’t stable relative to energy. This has been discussed. It’s not tied to energy cost. NLS’s estimation based on energy was a good starting point, but market forces will increasingly dominate.” (Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Slashdot Submission for 1.0, July 5, 2010, 21:31:14 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=234.msg1976#msg1976)Some have suggested that value comes from bitcoin being exchanged for dollars, proposing that regression transmits through this conversion. However, exchanges with dollars have always been at variable rates, determined by supply and demand, without any entity guaranteeing a fixed rate. Therefore, this hypothesis isn’t valid.\nAnother initial valuation hypothesis cites bitcoin’s ability to be a payment system. But this argument is circular: no one can pay in bitcoins if it has no value to anyone. Moreover, even if the network had facilitated dollar or euro transfers, such payments wouldn’t have been secure due to Bitcoin’s economically based mining security, which we’ll describe in Chapter 8.\nA related hypothesis is that individuals valued bitcoin for its ability to serve as a timestamping service—associating a date and time with specific information. Bitcoin allows arbitrary data to be written on its blockchain, guaranteeing their notarial authenticity; for example, one can publish a document’s hash in a transaction to prove its existence prior to the transaction’s confirmation date. However, for this anchoring to be useful, the ledger must be difficult to modify. Since Bitcoin’s security is essentially economic, this usage couldn’t have enabled initial valuation. Moreover, it didn’t happen this way: aside from the message in the first block (intended to prevent backdating the launch), no arbitrary data was inscribed on the chain before 2011.\nTo find reasons for bitcoin’s initial valuation, we must look to individuals’ strictly subjective preferences, not hypothetical objective use values. Examining Bitcoin’s early history, we observe two main reasons behind its valuation: cultural motivation and speculation.\nThe first reason is cultural motivation. According to this hypothesis, bitcoin was a collectible representing the principles its enthusiasts believed in. This drove people to acquire it even without material advantage. This aligns somewhat with valuing it as a payment system but with a distinction: individuals didn’t value bitcoin because it was immediately a good payment system but because they wanted the project to succeed.\nIn this vein, economist Konrad S. Graf spoke in 2013 of “components of direct use value,” which are “psychological or sociological, relating to factors such as inherent geek appeal, professional challenge to experts, curiosity, and signaling belonging.”20 Similarly, Ross Ulbricht, creator of the Silk Road marketplace, wrote in a 2019 essay:\n20 Konrad S. Graf, Bitcoins, the regression theorem, and that curious but unthreatening empirical world, February 27, 2013: https://www.konradsgraf.com/blog1/2013/2/27/in-depth-bitcoins-the-regression-theorem-and-that-curious-bu.html.*“It’s as if by magic that bitcoin could somehow come from nothing and, without prior value or authoritarian decree, become money. But Bitcoin didn’t emerge from a vacuum. It was the solution to a problem cryptographers had grappled with for years: How to create decentralized digital money that can’t be counterfeited and is trustworthy.\nThis problem persisted so long that some left its resolution to others and instead dreamed of what our future would be if decentralized digital currency became a reality. They dreamed of a future where the world’s economic power would be accessible to all, where value could be transferred anywhere with a button press. They dreamed of prosperity and freedom dependent solely on the mathematics of strong encryption.”*21\n21 Ross Ulbricht, Bitcoin Equals Freedom, September 25, 2019: https://rossulbricht.medium.com/bitcoin-equals-freedom-6c33986b4852.Thus, the dream of free digital money partly motivated bitcoin’s initial valuation. From the outset, the goal was to create money, and bitcoin was valued for this potential.\nBitcoin aligned notably with the American libertarian ideal, represented at the time by politician Ron Paul, who advocated to “End the Fed” and sought the Republican nomination for the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. The cypherpunks, mostly from the United States, largely shared this ideology. Satoshi himself acknowledged this proximity, stating in November 2008 that Bitcoin’s concept was “very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint.”22 Naturally, the first to assign value to bitcoin were these libertarians, like Martti Malmi, NewLibertyStandard, or later, Ross Ulbricht.\n22 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper, November 14, 2008, 18:55:35 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014853.html.The second reason is the speculative value arising from bitcoin’s potential as money. Bitcoin’s promise made it prudent to invest in it. Specifically, bitcoin was expected to become over time a currency with a fixed quantity (21 million), possessing absolute scarcity.\nThis unique characteristic captured imaginations. With a limited number of bitcoins and increasing monetary utility, their unit price would theoretically surge. This expectation fueled the speculative waves throughout the cryptocurrency’s history.\nThis idea appeared in January 2009 when Hal Finney estimated that bitcoin’s unit price could reach $10 million:\n“As a fun thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful and becomes the dominant payment system used worldwide. Then the total value of the currency should equal the total value of all wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, this would give each coin a value of about $10 million.”23\n23 Hal Finney, Re: Bitcoin v0.1 released, January 11, 2009, 01:22:01 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html.Though this estimation was debatable (money isn’t supposed to represent all the world’s wealth), it carried the notion that everyone could benefit from price appreciation.\nSubsequently, Satoshi himself used this logic to attract potential users. On January 16, he stated that “it might make sense to get some just in case it catches on” and that “if enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.”24 On February 18, he wrote that “as the number of users grows, the value per coin increases,” which could “attract more users,” creating a “positive feedback loop” for the system.25\n24 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin v0.1 released, January 16, 2009, 16:03:14 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015014.html.25 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency, February 18, 2009: https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008:Comment:9562.26 Hal Finney, Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper, November 13, 2008, 15:24:18 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014848.html.27 “I saw Hal’s message and that’s one of the reasons I started a node so quickly. My systems aren’t doing much else when idle, so why not create Bitcoins? And if they’re worth something someday…? Bonus!”—Dustin Trammell, Re: Bitcoin v0.1 released, January 16, 2009, 01:14:27 UTC.28 Snapshot of NewLibertyStandard’s website, December 2009: https://web.archive.org/web/20091229132559/http://newlibertystandard.wetpaint.com/.Thus, these two reasons—cultural and speculative—primarily contributed to bitcoin’s initial valuation. Early miners used their computers and expended energy because Bitcoin’s idea aligned with their moral values and they “felt they were making a beneficial contribution to the world,”26 or because they foresaw potential profit.27 Those willing to accept bitcoins in exchange for other things did so for the same reasons. NewLibertyStandard, the first to exchange dollars for bitcoins in October 2009, was convinced that Bitcoin was “an economic revolution” and “the standard of digital money.”28\nAs an anonymous internet user wrote in 2012, “the early Bitcoin enthusiasts were the kind of people (due to their interest in cryptocurrencies) to consider Bitcoin as something beautiful.”29 It’s this beauty that sparked the monetary reality we know today.\n29 qbg, Comment: Bitcoin and the Regression Theorem of Money, December 8, 2012: https://voluntaryistreader.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/bitcoin-and-the-regression-theorem-of-money/#comment-135.",

    "section": "The Currency of Disobedience",
    "text": "The Currency of Disobedience\nWhen presenting Bitcoin, questions about its value proposition arise immediately. Why Bitcoin? What sets it apart from state currencies, its main competitors? Why use bitcoin as money instead of the dollar or euro?\nBecause bitcoin, due to its decentralized and open nature, is a less effective currency than the dollar or euro in many cases: it’s less widely accepted, harder to use, involves transaction fees, has fluctuating purchasing power, and poses more legal risks. These reasons make fiat currencies and centralized solutions more efficient (and will continue to be) in most situations.\nThis doesn’t render Bitcoin useless—it just needs to be viewed from a particular perspective. Bitcoin is a “permissionless” monetary system, usable without anyone’s authorization. It’s electronic cash enabling direct and confidential exchanges between individuals without intermediaries. It offers the ability to have full control over one’s funds and make transfers without fear of observation or censorship, to any recipient, anywhere, anytime.\nIts value proposition stems from these straightforward characteristics. By being uncontrollable, Bitcoin serves as an instrument of disobedience to social norms and, especially, political power. It removes banks’ and states’ power to control and select transactions, which allows them to oversee economic activity, and their power over monetary issuance, which enables them to extract seigniorage revenue. Bitcoin is thus a concept of censorship-resistant money, difficult to prevent transactions, and inflation-resistant, hard to create more units than initially planned.\nBitcoin is built in opposition to the authorities and is part of the longstanding struggle against human subjugation. Its existence affirms the primacy of natural law over positive law, the superiority of individual property over collectivism. It fits within the liberal tradition of the right of resistance (jus resistendi), justifying individuals’ or groups’ secession against unjust laws—a right recognized by two major 18th-century revolutions: the American and French Revolutions.\nIt’s a tool of civil disobedience, a concept outlined by Étienne de La Boétie in the 16th century, theorized by Henry David Thoreau in 1849, and practiced by Gandhi through satyāgraha in India and by Martin Luther King in the civil rights movement against racial segregation in the U.S. It’s a message to the earthly sovereign, rejecting his decrees and declaring: “I will no longer use your currency.”\nBitcoin was created to gain individual independence. Originating from the cypherpunk movement—a technical disobedience movement advocating proactive use of cryptography on the Internet to protect privacy and freedom—Bitcoin was launched by Satoshi Nakamoto without seeking permission from authorities, explicitly aiming to enhance freedom. On November 6, 2008, responding to someone stating he “wouldn’t find a solution to political problems in cryptography,” he said:\n“Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.”30\n30 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper, November 6, 2008, 20:15:40 UTC, https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014823.html.Thus, it’s natural that the core activities built on Bitcoin lie at the margins of general public approval. Bitcoin involves reclaiming individual sovereignty against authority—a move that can be unpopular when laws have majority acceptance. It serves a niche market whose size depends on the proportion of the population willing to disobey.\nCentral uses of Bitcoin include political opposition. It can be an alternative means of funding (receiving) and payment (sending) for political organizations, often labeled extreme right or left, whose financial integrity is challenged by authorities.\nJulian Assange and WikiLeaks exemplify this. After 2010 revelations about U.S. military practices in Afghanistan and Iraq, the organization faced a financial blockade from Mastercard, Visa, Western Union, Bank of America, and others, eliminating 95% of its revenue.31 This pushed it to accept bitcoin donations in June 2011, which, though modest at first, became substantial as bitcoin’s value increased years later.\n31 WikiLeaks, Banking Blockade, October 24, 2011, 13:00 UTC, https://wikileaks.org/Banking-Blockade.html.32 Jamie Crawley, “Edward Snowden says use crypto, don’t invest in it: ‘Bitcoin is what I used to pay for the servers pseudonymously’”, Fortune, June 11, 2022: https://fortune.com/2022/06/11/edward-snowden-says-use-crypto-dont-invest-in-it-bitcoin-is-what-i-used-to-pay-for-the-servers-pseudonymously/.Another case is whistleblower Edward Snowden, a former CIA and NSA employee who revealed mass surveillance of the Internet and U.S. phone networks in 2013. Pursued by the U.S. for “espionage, theft, and unauthorized use of government property,” he sought asylum in Russia, obtaining citizenship in 2022. Snowden supports Bitcoin, having used it in 2013 to pay for servers that shared information anonymously.32 He also promoted the cryptocurrency ZCash for its privacy features, participating in its 2016 initialization ceremony.\nA third example is Alexei Navalny, Vladimir Putin’s main opponent in Russia, founder of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), whose bank accounts were frozen in 2019 before its liquidation in 2021. Navalny has used Bitcoin for funding since 2017, with the equivalent of several million dollars passing through his address.33 According to his deputy, Leonid Volkov, bitcoin contributions represented 10% of their total funding. Navalny was incarcerated in Russia in January 2021 and remained so in November 2023.34\n33 Alexei Navalny’s main address was 3QzYvaRFY6bakFBW4YBRrzmwzTnfZcaA6E.34 Alexei Navalny died in prison in February 2024. (Note from January 2025.)35 The donation page is at https://sci-hub.se/donate. The former address 1K4t2vSBSS2xFjZ6PofYnbgZewjeqbG1TM (from an earlier site snapshot: https://web.archive.org/web/20160202212649/http://sci-hub.la/) received 94.42594975 BTC between 07/03/2015 and 11/14/2020. Other addresses linked to Sci-Hub are 12PCbUDS4ho7vgSccmixKTHmq9qL2mdSns and bc1q7eqheemcu6xpgr42vl0ayel6wj087nxdfjfndf.Another use aligning with disobedience is funding the scientific article-sharing platform Sci-Hub, founded in 2011 by Alexandra Elbakyan, a young Kazakh inspired by communist ideals. The site’s purpose (still online) is to provide free access to knowledge by sharing articles and works freely, defying copyright laws. Due to its illegal nature, the platform accepted bitcoin donations from its inception, receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars.35 It also faced recurring issues with PayPal, its only other revenue source, which permanently closed its account in 2020.\nMore broadly, Bitcoin is useful geopolitically. The system isn’t tied to any jurisdiction and isn’t concerned with borders. It allows sending funds abroad while bypassing various constraints and regulations.\nThis makes it valuable for emigrants sending money to family in their home countries. These remittances often rely on centralized solutions like Western Union and MoneyGram, which charge high fees.\nSimilarly, Bitcoin can circumvent economic sanctions imposed by states on their populations amid power struggles. Its utility was evident following the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022, when the Western bloc imposed heavy financial sanctions on Russia. Bitcoin served both Russian citizens, who couldn’t receive foreign funds, and Ukrainian nationals in occupied regions.\nThus, anyone under an authoritarian regime seeking to bypass laws or rebel against the status quo may find Bitcoin beneficial. This is where Bitcoin’s core use lies: in what’s forbidden and what can easily become so.",

    "section": "The Currency of the Black Market",
    "text": "The Currency of the Black Market\nBitcoin is an electronic cash system usable confidentially, without permission, and with low censorship risk. Consequently, it’s particularly suitable for economic activity escaping state supervision and taxation—what we commonly call the black market.\nThe term “black market” entered French during World War II under German occupation, translating the German Schwarzmarkt, dating back to World War I. It originally referred to clandestine markets circumventing trade regulations.\nThe term wasn’t used earlier because regulations weren’t pervasive enough to necessitate such a concept—the exchange of goods occurred simply in the market. Only “au noir” existed, describing undeclared activities hidden from authorities. As societies became more regulated, based on explicit laws rather than implicit norms, distinguishing regulated markets from free markets became necessary, leading to the term’s emergence.\nThe black market concept is vague, covering both individual commercial activities and large-scale trafficking, the sale of legitimate goods and services, and products from criminal exploitation. Clarification is needed. Here, we define the black market as the free economy where goods and services—legal and illegal—are exchanged without regulation or taxation and aren’t direct products of aggression. This includes the “grey market,” where legal goods and services are traded (like undeclared work), and excludes the “red market,” involving crimes like murder, extortion, or slavery.\nTo describe activities escaping state control and taxation, terms like underground economy, clandestine economy, or parallel economy are also used. This economy falls under the broader informal economy, not necessarily commercial, including activities like domestic work36. In developing countries, this represents a significant economic portion.\n36 Domestic work (cooking, cleaning, laundry, childcare, etc.) was previously mainly done by women before they left the home and this work became taxed like any other. The society promoted by the modern state is primarily mercantile, where everything is sold and taxable from birth to death.37 Joël Drogland, “La France du marché noir”, La Cliothèque, May 2, 2008: https://clio-cr.clionautes.org/la-france-du-marche-noir-1940-1949.html.38 The term comes from Gregory Grossman’s 1977 article “The Second Economy of the USSR”.The black market thrives under restrictive economic conditions. During World War II37, its success stemmed from severe shortages caused by the war, price controls, and harsh conditions imposed by the German occupiers. The French population faced drastic rationing (the official adult food ration was 1,100 calories per day in 1942) and excessive levies through pillaging, taxes, or requisitions. Resorting to the black market became a necessity. The underground economy also prospered under repressive regimes, notably in the Soviet Union, where it was a “second economy” essential for survival38.\nBut the black market isn’t just a controversial phenomenon; it’s also foundational for a doctrine called agorism. Derived from the Ancient Greek ἀγορά (agora, meaning “marketplace”), agorism is a political philosophy from libertarianism, advocating the underground economy’s practice as a peaceful means to reduce state influence. The doctrine was theorized in the 1970s by Samuel Edward Konkin III39, a Canadian in the U.S., an avid reader of Mises and Rothbard, seeking to radicalize the Austrian School’s vision. After practicing his philosophy, he documented it in the 1980 New Libertarian Manifesto.\n39 The term “agorism” was coined by Konkin for his presentation at the Free Enterprise Forum in February 1974.40 Libertarianism is based on the non-aggression axiom formulated by economist Murray Rothbard in For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto in 1973: “No individual or group has the right to initiate force against another, threatening or committing physical violence against another’s person or property.”41 The term counter-economy mirrors “counter-culture,” referencing the 1960s alternative culture in which Konkin participated.Agorism aimed to unite libertarian theory, based on the non-aggression principle40, with black market practices (which Konkin called the “counter-economy”41) focused on profit pursuit. It was a strategy to progressively eradicate aggression (including the state’s) through self-interested individual actions, creating a free society—the agora.\nKonkin applied Mises and Rothbard’s analyses to the underground economy, considering the risk associated with illegal activity (fines, imprisonment, harm) as entrepreneurial risk. He wrote:\n*“Why do people engage in the counter-economy without protection? Because the gain relative to the risk taken exceeds the expected loss. This applies to any economic activity, but for the counter-economy, it deserves special attention:\nThe fundamental principle of the counter-economy is to trade risk for profit.”*42\n42 Samuel Edward Konkin III, New Libertarian Manifesto, KoPubCo, 2006.Thus, agorism encouraged improving one’s life by slipping through the state’s net, rather than engaging",

    "text": "The State and Taxation\nFrom a sociological standpoint, the State is traditionally defined as a sovereign authority exercised over a determined territory and a people it officially represents. Three elements characterize it: power over a population, control of a territory, and a certain level of acceptance.\nFirstly, the State inherently utilizes physical force: its existence depends on coercion, imposed through violence or the threat of violence, via police and military forces. This force is exerted over a group of people under its dominion, called subjects or citizens, whose natural freedom it restricts, typically through laws and decrees outlining prohibitions. In particular, it levies taxes (a term derived from the Latin impōnō, meaning “to impose” or “to place upon”), which, in effect, are wealth extractions lacking individual consent1.\nSecondly, the State’s authority is enforced through domination over a specific territory. This control allows it to consolidate its wealth extraction within defined borders: since humans need land (or sea) to exercise their abilities, controlling territory greatly facilitates their subjugation. This domination over land explains the feudal organization (from the medieval Latin feodum, meaning “fief”) of the State in agrarian societies.\nToday, taxation is collected through numerous controls executed by the State. These controls primarily involve financial surveillance, notably within the banking sector: banks and other financial institutions are accountable to the tax administration, required to report suspicious client information. This surveillance is facilitated by various laws, such as restrictions on cash usage. Within the territory, tax collection relies on fiscal audits, which encompass methods to examine declarations, compare them to actual circumstances, and increase tax bases if necessary. Preserving the State’s tax revenue also involves hindering wealth outflows through customs and capital controls. All these measures closely relate to financial censorship, discussed in Chapter 9 of this work.\nTax collection within the territory primarily occurs through established economic actors, even when they’re not directly taxed. In France, for example, the value-added tax levied on goods and services is paid by the customer but remitted by the merchant, who must include it in the sale price. Similarly, many fiscal charges are withheld at the source by companies but paid by their employees, such as the generalized social contribution and, currently, income tax. This use of “indirect” taxation reduces the number of individuals to monitor and makes the levy “painless” for those who truly bear the cost.\nThirdly, the State benefits from a broad acceptance by the population, ranging from active approval to passive resignation. This acceptance differentiates it from organized criminal groups, which generally lack such legitimacy. Although temporary and partial, this acceptance underpins the concept of a “social contract,” which, rather than being a genuine legal contract, acknowledges the existing situation. Thus, the State derives its name from embodying the current state of power relations within society.\nThe population’s acceptance ensures the longevity of tax collection, reducing the need for sheer force to maintain authority. The State asserts its legitimacy by claiming to represent the interests of the people living within its territory, employing various ideologies to render contributors compliant and to minimize rebellions.\nIn particular, the State claims a monopoly on defensive violence2, guaranteeing internal order (through the police) and defense against external enemies (via the military). This genuine service is not performed altruistically: the State’s interest lies in defending productive forces against internal and external disruptions while preventing them from organizing their own protection, aiming to stabilize its tax revenue. This monopoly resembles protective coercion accepted by the population as a lesser evil.\nSince taxation is the cornerstone of the State’s structure, paying taxes holds a sacred status. This explains why tax avoidance is consistently condemned, even when legal. It’s also why tax resistance is severely repressed, including through restrictions on freedom of expression in this domain. In France, for example, calling for a tax strike is illegal, punishable by a €3,750 fine and six months’ imprisonment3.\nHowever, the State’s capacity to extract wealth is not limitless. Firstly, there is a delicate balance between the effective level of wealth extraction and the resulting economic destruction, which varies according to the beneficiaries’ time preferences4. Secondly, the level of extraction depends on the population’s acceptance, and there is inevitably a point where raising tax rates reduces total revenue—a phenomenon illustrated by the Laffer curve. Finally, the capacity for extraction depends on the State’s technical means, notably regarding surveillance, and on the tools available to the population for tax resistance, which, of course, include Bitcoin.\nThus, the State embodies organized, institutionalized violence, with its primary function being to enforce non-consensual wealth transfer. Rather than a specific group of identified individuals, it should be understood as a series of actions performed by people within a particular context. Therefore, we will refer to the State in the singular, as a concept manifesting in various instances that operate on the same principles.",

    "section": "Money and Seigniorage",
    "text": "Money and Seigniorage\nWe discuss the State because it maintains a close relationship with money. As seen in Chapter 3, the State has gradually claimed increasing prerogatives over defining the medium of exchange, initially by guaranteeing its certification and now by controlling its issuance. This situation has led some theorists, including Chartalists, to adopt a fiscal approach to money, viewing tax payment as the original source of its value.\nThis close relationship is explained by the significant benefit the State derives: seigniorage5, the direct financial advantage resulting from currency issuance for the issuer. Seigniorage is inherently an indirect expropriation of currency holders, much more effective in the short term than direct taxation. Debt, often cited as a third method, is essentially deferred taxation or disguised seigniorage.\n5 “Seigniorage” originates from Old French seignorage, referring to the privilege of minting money in the Middle Ages, typically reserved for feudal lords.6 Jörg Guido Hülsmann, The Ethics of Money Production, Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2008.Seigniorage involves profiting from a specific industry: money production. It results from four fundamental legal measures: legalized counterfeiting, monopoly over production, imposition of legal tender, and suspension of payments6. Like taxation, these actions are widely accepted because they emanate from public authority.\nLegalized counterfeiting involves circulating money whose certification doesn’t match public expectations. Typically, this means issuing coins with less metal content than existing ones or representative notes where the base money held in reserve is fractionally backed.\nA monopoly over money production grants exclusive issuance rights to an entity, eliminating competition and allowing it to sell currency at higher prices than in a free market. This privilege is usually delegated to a State-controlled entity, such as a mint or central bank.\nLegal tender laws compel economic actors to accept a currency at its nominal value as dictated by the State. This imposition can be limited to deferred payments (as in Anglo-Saxon contexts) or broader, covering all transactions (common in continental Europe7). The goal is to favor the State-issued currency by overvaluing it against competitors.\n7 For example, in France, legal tender of cash is mandated by Article R642-3 of the Penal Code: “Refusing to accept coins or banknotes with legal tender status in France at their face value is punishable by a fine for second-class contraventions.”Throughout history, legal tender has taken various forms. It appeared in bimetallism, where the gold-to-silver ratio was arbitrarily fixed, favoring one metal over the other. During the classical gold standard, representative notes had to be exchanged at par with specie. It was also evident in the gold exchange standard, requiring secondary countries’ national currencies to have legal tender at fixed rates against the pound or dollar, maintained artificially through exchange controls. Today, legal tender relates to foreign exchange rates, prohibiting differential pricing based on the medium of exchange used.\nSuspension of payments allows a central bank to temporarily halt repayments to clients, leading to forced tender. In the case of representative notes, this legal measure enabled banks to hold less gold in reserve by preventing withdrawals during confidence crises.\nFrom antiquity until the 19th century, money consisted of precious metal coins—primarily gold, silver, and sometimes copper. Thus, sovereigns couldn’t create new units from nothing but could devalue existing coins by reducing their metal content.\nIn ancient Rome, the silver denarius (origin of the word “denier”) was repeatedly devalued, slowly at first, before its metal content was drastically reduced during the 3rd-century crisis. The seigniorage gained allowed the Roman Empire to continue financing its dominance without further territorial expansion. Similarly, European sovereigns manipulated coinage throughout the Middle Ages. These practices were notably observed by Christian philosopher Nicolas Oresme in the 14th century.\nSuch manipulation had another unfortunate effect: driving undervalued currency out of circulation, leading it to be hoarded or exported. This phenomenon is known as Gresham’s Law, named after Sir Thomas Gresham, a prominent 16th-century English merchant and financier who linked the disappearance of better-quality silver coins from circulation to contemporary legal measures8. Commonly summarized as “bad money drives out good,” the law states that when a fixed legal exchange rate exists between two currencies, the overvalued (bad) currency tends to replace the undervalued (good) one in commerce. This principle also applies, to a lesser extent, to representative and fiat money.\n8 Gresham’s Law was formalized by Scottish economist Henry Dunning Macleod in his Elements of Political Economy (1858).The rise of modern banks during the Renaissance led to the emergence of convertible banknotes, making value transfer more convenient. Authorities co-opted this innovation by monopolizing banknote issuance, turning them into supposed representative instruments.\nIn this context, seigniorage involved creating more banknotes than there was precious metal in reserve—a form of financial fraud. However, a significant portion of metal still had to be kept to prevent creditors from emptying vaults. While the State could suspend payments (as it did historically), such actions led to drastic loss of confidence in banknotes relative to the metal they represented. This constraint kept the gold standard relatively stable monetarily but paved the way for a more inflationary regime: paper money.\nSeigniorage gained prominence with the advent of paper money—a physical form of fiat currency. It became as simple as creating more banknotes mandated for use within the territory, far more efficient than devaluing coins or committing fraud with representative notes.\nFrom its inception, paper money financed grand State projects, notably modern warfare. For instance, the issuance of American greenbacks (named for their green-inked reverse) between 1861 and 1865 supported the Civil War efforts. Similarly, World War I was largely financed through monetary creation and inflation-induced debt reduction.\nTo prevent excessive flight to more reliable competing currencies, States implemented exchange controls regulating foreign currency transactions, maintaining artificially high currency values despite collapsing confidence. The common pretext was combating “speculation.”\nHowever, even with paper money’s unprecedented benefits, the ability to profit wasn’t unlimited: producing coins and banknotes and combating private counterfeiting incurred unavoidable costs that reduced seigniorage. This partly explains the current push to replace physical cash with entirely digital money.\nFinally, like taxation, seigniorage depends on public acceptance, bolstered by restricting free expression. In France, for example, it’s illegal to undermine public confidence in the currency; violators face a €9,000 fine and two years in prison9.\n9 Article 1 of the law of August 18, 1836, repressing attacks on the nation’s credit, states: “Anyone who, by any means, knowingly spreads false facts or misleading allegations among the public, likely to directly or indirectly undermine confidence in the solidity of the currency, the value of State funds of any kind, funds of departments and communes, public institutions, and, in general, all organizations where the aforementioned communities have direct or indirect participation, shall be punished with two years’ imprisonment and a €9,000 fine.”",

    "section": "Price Inflation",
    "text": "Price Inflation\nSeigniorage’s primary consequence is price inflation. Originating from the Latin inflatio, meaning “swelling” or “expansion,” inflation refers to the loss of money’s purchasing power, resulting in a general and sustained price increase. It’s a long-term phenomenon affecting the entire economy.\nContrary to common belief, not all price increases signify inflation. Due to its enduring nature, inflation is inherently structural rather than cyclical. Temporary State-imposed measures might raise prices but don’t constitute inflation per se.\nPrice inflation has been observed in numerous economies. It accompanied the Roman Empire’s decline from the 3rd century, peaking under Emperor Diocletian. Modern economies experienced it after both World Wars, during the 1970s, and more recently in the 2020s.\nInflation can stem from a general demand increase or a supply decrease of goods and services. Theoretically, several factors can cause it, such as monetary inflation, energy scarcity, war-induced wealth destruction, or capital flight. In practice, in a growing, peaceful, and independent economy, long-term price inflation generally results from monetary inflation.\nMonetary inflation is the excessive production of money beyond what the free market would naturally generate10. It arises from State manipulation of currency to profit through seigniorage. States often sacrifice long-term purchasing power for short-term revenue, especially during military, political, or health crises.\n10 Defined by Guido Hülsmann as “the increase of the nominal quantity of a medium of exchange beyond what would have been produced on the free market.” — Jörg Guido Hülsmann, The Ethics of Money Production, p. 85.11 Richard Cantillon, Essay on the Nature of Trade in General, McMaster University Archive for the History of Economic Thought, 1755.Inflation is often misunderstood because it’s not the uniform, instantaneous phenomenon many imagine. Injecting money into the economy has a progressive and varied impact on prices as it diffuses through transactions. This is known as the Cantillon Effect, observed in 1730 by economist Richard Cantillon in his Essay on the Nature of Trade in General, where he stated that “an increase of actual money [causes] in a State a proportionate increase of consumption, which [produces] by degrees an increase in prices11.”\nThe Cantillon Effect applies across space and time. Newly produced money may concentrate in specific areas (like urban centers), regions (even outside national borders), or economic sectors (such as finance). Its spread can be delayed by practices like monthly salary payments. However, the increased money supply eventually impacts the entire economy.\nMeanwhile, those closest to the money issuance benefit first. The issuer spends it, adding demand and potentially offering higher prices for desired goods. The merchant receiving it, now temporarily wealthier, spends more generously with another merchant. This cycle continues until it reaches the economy’s fringes, resulting in those farthest from the issuance being most adversely affected.\nThus, price inflation is a delayed manifestation of monetary inflation from excessive State seigniorage. If unchecked, it can ultimately destroy the unit of account, leading to hyperinflation. In such cases, inflation is driven less by money production (which struggles to keep pace) and more by capital flight to stronger currencies or liquid assets.",

    "section": "Central Banks",
    "text": "Central Banks\nToday’s global monetary system is founded on the central bank model. A central bank is an institution with a monopoly on issuing the legally recognized currency within a territory. Every country utilizes such an institution to manage its fiat currency.\nCentral banks emerged from State control over banking activities. Modern banking—trading money and credit—developed during the Renaissance, based on innovations like demand deposits and bills of exchange, which evolved into checking accounts and banknotes as credit became a monetary substitute.\nOver time, authorities centralized banking by establishing public banks with advantages over private competitors. Initially confined to cities (like the Banco del Rialto in Venice, 1587, or Sweden’s Sveriges Riksbank in 1668), some evolved into national banks, such as the Bank of England (1694) and France’s Bank (1800).\nCentral banks gained prominence by securing note issuance monopolies. The Bank of England obtained this through the 1844 Bank Charter Act. Similar developments occurred elsewhere, like the Royal Bank of Prussia in 1846 and the Bank of France’s nationwide issuance privilege in 1848. The United States established its central bank, the Federal Reserve, in 1913.\nDespite claims of independence, central banks aren’t separate from the State. They rely on State enforcement for their monopolies and legal tender status, while the State depends on them for seigniorage revenue. Thus, central banks are integral to the State apparatus.\nThis centralization led to the enduring establishment of fiat paper money. Initially backed by precious metals (like gold during the 1873–1914 classical gold standard), direct convertibility was gradually suspended—temporarily during wars and then permanently from World War I onwards. In 1971, any gold reference was abandoned when President Nixon ended the Bretton Woods system.\nCentral banks now play a dominant role, heavily influencing economies through monetary policy. Their primary missions include limiting price inflation (often targeting a 2% annual CPI increase) and acting as lenders of last resort12, providing liquidity during credit crunches. Secondary goals might include reducing unemployment.\n12 The central bank’s role as lender of last resort was theorized in the 19th century—Henry Thornton, An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, 1802; Walter Bagehot, Lombard Street, 1873.To achieve these aims, central banks typically utilize three tools: producing physical money, purchasing securities on financial markets, and influencing credit issuance via key interest rates. They may produce physical currency or delegate this task (e.g., the ECB delegates to national banks).\nThey engage in open market operations, buying and selling securities (like government bonds) on the interbank market. Unconventional policies, such as quantitative easing, provide liquidity during crises but primarily finance State debt—expanding balance sheets indicate seigniorage.\nKey interest rates influence bank credit issuance. These rates include the refinancing rate (standard rate for banks obtaining central money), marginal lending rate (short-term emergency funds), and deposit facility rate (interest on reserves held at the central bank). These rates, set by the central bank, can even be negative, affecting lending and borrowing behaviors.\nThrough these mechanisms, central banks—and thus the State—extract seigniorage by lending central money to commercial banks, which then lend to borrowers, dispersing funds throughout the economy via investment and consumption.\nIn this hierarchical system, commercial banks also profit from their position. Forming a cartel, they enjoy credit issuance privileges and protection from economic fallout via central bank support and potential Treasury bailouts13. This encourages credit expansion, fueling economic booms and busts, leading to malinvestment and recessions.\n13 Commercial bank customers are encouraged to keep funds in banks by partial protection against bank failure through deposit guarantee schemes, like France’s FGDR or the U.S.’s FDIC.Criticism of this banking system grew after the 1971 abandonment of Bretton Woods. Satoshi Nakamoto joined this critique in February 2009, highlighting the system’s flaws to promote Bitcoin:\n“The fundamental problem with conventional currency is all the trust required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve14.”\n14 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency, February 11, 2009: https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source.Thus, central banks result from banking centralization. They’re no longer banks issuing substitutes but are now currency creators, replacing mints that once struck coins.\nNotably, the control over banknotes and their eventual detachment from precious metals led to fiat money’s establishment. Similarly, controlling bank accounts is ongoing. With the State’s deposit guarantees and the digitization of bank credit, conditions are ripe for another shift—central bank digital currencies.",

    "section": "Central Bank Digital Currency",
    "text": "Central Bank Digital Currency\nA central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a digital fiat currency issued by a central bank. It’s entirely digital and doesn’t represent a claim on assets. CBDC systems are currently being designed worldwide, potentially marking a significant evolution in monetary history by indirectly nationalizing bank deposits.\nThe idea of a central bank managing a digital currency competing with commercial bank money isn’t new, predating widespread Internet use. Economist James Tobin suggested in 1987:\n“I believe the government should make available to the public a medium of exchange offering the convenience of deposits and the safety of currency, essentially currency in the form of deposits, transferable in any amount by check or other order15.”\n15 James Tobin, “The Case for Preserving Regulatory Distinctions,” in Proceedings—Economic Policy Symposium—Jackson Hole, 1987, pp. 167–205.16 peculium, Fedcoin: A centrally-issued alternative to peer-to-peer currencies, March 26, 2013.17 Jean-Luc (Bitcoin.fr), Birth of Eurocoin, April 1, 2014.18 David Andolfatto, Fedcoin: On the Desirability of a Government Cryptocurrency, February 3, 2015.Bitcoin’s emergence reignited interest in such a currency. Initially discussed humorously within the Bitcoin community (e.g., “Fedcoin” in 201316 or “Eurocoin” in 201417), the concept gained serious attention when David Andolfatto of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis promoted it in 201518.\nThe term “central bank digital currency” gained prominence after Ben Broadbent’s 2016 speech19, discussing how distributed ledgers could revolutionize interbank settlements and allow individuals to hold central bank accounts, competing with cash and bank deposits.\n19 Ben Broadbent, Central banks and digital currencies, March 2, 2016.20 James Lovejoy et al., A High Performance Payment Processing System Designed for Central Bank Digital Currencies, February 3, 2022.Since then, experimental implementations have emerged. China’s People’s Bank began deploying its digital yuan in 2020. Sweden’s Riksbank started testing the e-Krona in 2016. In the U.S., the MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative partnered with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on Project Hamilton, a CBDC prototype20.\nTechnically, a CBDC would use a distributed ledger across several servers, employing consensus mechanisms suited for high transaction volumes. Financial data replication enhances resilience against failures or cyberattacks.\nAccess would require user identification, likely through digital identity systems, aligning with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism regulations. Transactions would be private from the public but observable by authorized entities.\nProgrammable features could allow conditional spending, and the system could evolve to include new functionalities.\nFor users, CBDCs offer multiple benefits: eliminating credit counterparty risk, enhancing accessibility and financial inclusion by “banking the unbanked,” and automating financial operations to improve online services.\nWhile CBDCs seem to modernize outdated physical money, they present significant potential for increased State control and disadvantages for individuals.\nFor the State, CBDCs offer total financial control. They could legally eliminate cash, as CBDCs would constitute base money with easily defined legal tender. This leads to the gradual disappearance of physical money.\nEnhanced financial surveillance becomes feasible, with automated processing via artificial intelligence. Tax collection could be streamlined through direct account debits, as discussed in Chapter 9 on censorship resistance.\nAdditionally, CBDCs have inflationary potential. Replacing cash reduces production and distribution costs, improving seigniorage on base money. Gradually supplanting bank credit allows the State to reclaim seigniorage from commercial banks, possibly diminishing or eliminating their lending capacity. Banks might then serve as intermediaries within the system.\nCommercial banks could be absorbed into the central bank, fulfilling the Marxist vision of centralized credit21. Like the Gosbank in the Soviet Union, this singular bank would follow central directives, issuing loans financed by monetary creation to favored entities.\n21 Point 5 of the Communist Manifesto advocates “centralization of credit in the hands of the State through a national bank with State capital and exclusive monopoly.” — Karl Marx, Manifesto of the Communist Party, 1895.Though this seems unlikely, the dangers of such a system might not deter its adoption. Public acceptance is challenging but not impossible. Incentives might encourage CBDC use, while penalties discourage refusal. Rewards could include subsidies for merchants and consumers (as seen with China’s digital yuan), while punishments might involve imposing legal tender laws, denying access to public services without a central bank account, and censoring anti-CBDC opinions as conspiratorial.\nUltimately, CBDC adoption hinges on public acceptance. While resistance exists, the State may prevail over time, as it did with paper money. In that scenario, Bitcoin could remain the only viable monetary alternative for dissenters.",

    "section": "Jurisdictional Arbitrage",
    "text": "Jurisdictional Arbitrage\nA common strategy to safeguard individual freedom against State control is “jurisdictional arbitrage.” This involves exploiting differences between jurisdictions to optimize living conditions—for example, emigrating to benefit from lower taxes. Such actions might pressure States to respect citizens’ freedoms through competition, effectively a form of “voting with one’s feet.”\nJurisdictional arbitrage emerged as migration costs dropped due to relaxed movement restrictions, reduced travel expenses, and increased asset liquidity. The Internet further amplified this by allowing individuals to partially escape local authorities’ influence.\nAuthors Rees-Mogg and Davidson discussed this in The Sovereign Individual (1997), predicting Nation-States’ decline due to technological innovation. They proposed an “inequivalence theorem” opposing Ricardian equivalence, suggesting that rational individuals would relocate rather than save more in response to increased taxes:\n“In the Information Age, […] rational individuals will respond to prospective tax increases for deficit financing by moving residence or conducting transactions elsewhere. […] Sovereign Individuals and other rational actors can be expected to flee jurisdictions with large unfunded obligations22.”\n22 William Rees-Mogg, James Dale Davidson, The Sovereign Individual, Touchstone, 1999, p. 247.23 John Perry Barlow, A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, February 8, 1996.Cypherpunks shared this view, seeing cyberspace as an independent jurisdiction beyond State reach23. They envisioned a cybercurrency outside State control. Eric Hughes noted in 1994:\n“The biggest question is: How big can monetary flows on the networks grow before the State demands reporting every transaction? If flows become large enough, a transnational service might be economically incentivized to issue a currency, rendering State actions irrelevant24.”\n24 Kevin Kelly, “E-Money,” in Out of Control, Addison-Wesley, 1994.25 Parker Lewis, Bitcoin Cannot be Banned, August 11, 2019.Widespread jurisdictional arbitrage could naturally lead to sound money’s emergence. If States compete and individuals move freely, people might favor less-taxed currencies, like gold-based or Bitcoin-based ones, prompting States to adopt better currencies to attract prosperity25.\nHowever, this appealing theory overlooks the power dynamics between States. States aren’t independent; they compete to extract resources from populations, primarily through territorial control—a conflict that can escalate to war. Decreasing a State’s tax revenue might invite imperialistic interference from dominant powers. Therefore, inter-State competition is less economic and more political, involving sanctions restricting economic and migratory flows.\nMonetary imperialism—favoring one’s currency abroad through force or its threat—is a facet of this, seeking additional seigniorage from wider currency use26. The U.S. has practiced this with the dollar since the early 20th century, notably via the Bretton Woods system.\n26 Hans-Hermann Hoppe, “Banking, Nation States, and International Politics,” in The Review of Austrian Economics, vol. 4, no. 3, 1990, pp. 55–87.Thus, it’s naive to believe a dominant State would tolerate a subordinate State issuing a superior, widely usable currency. Jurisdictional arbitrage applies only marginally, as long as it doesn’t significantly weaken central authority. Meaningful monetary change relies on individual disobedience in the medium term.",

    "text": "Centralized Alternative Currencies\nIn response to enforced monetary systems, some individuals have attempted to create alternatives—not local currencies with limited goals, but those aiming to counterbalance State currencies. The U.S. offers notable examples due to its tradition of private currencies and individual freedom.\nDuring the colonial period and early 19th century, private coinage and relatively free banking were common. However, post–Civil War measures ended this freedom. The 1864 Congressional Act prohibited private coinage27, and the National Banking Acts centralized banking.\n27 The 1864 law became 18 U.S. Code § 486, prohibiting private coinage.The Secret Service was established in 1865 to combat counterfeiting and financial fraud, indirectly reinforcing monetary monopolies. This centralization culminated with the Federal Reserve’s creation in 1913 and the 1933 gold possession ban.\nAfter abandoning gold references and with the Internet’s rise, private currency ideas resurfaced. Individuals, inspired by Hayekian principles, sought to introduce their own currencies. Notable projects include ALH&Co, the Liberty Dollar, e-gold, and Liberty Reserve.\nALH&Co, founded by Anthony L. Hargis, offered gold- or dollar-denominated accounts28. Despite efforts to remain legal, it facilitated tax evasion and was ultimately shut down in 2004 after legal action.\n28 Wendy McElroy, “Anthony L. Hargis And The Trusted Third Party Trap,” Agorist Nexus, May 14, 2020.29 P. Carl Mullan, A History of Digital Currency in the United States, Palgrave Macmillan, 2016.The Liberty Dollar, created by Bernard von NotHaus in 1998, was based on gold and silver coins, notes, and later digital units. It faced legal challenges for resembling official currency and was shut down, with von NotHaus convicted in 201129.\nE-gold, founded in 1996 by Douglas Jackson and Barry Downey, was a digital gold currency. At its peak, it held 3.6 tons of gold and managed millions of accounts. After being implicated in money laundering and operating without a license, it was closed in 200930.\n30 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin v0.1 released, January 25, 2009.Liberty Reserve, established in 2006 by Arthur Budovsky, allowed transactions in currencies pegged to the dollar, euro, or gold. It was shut down in 2013 following international legal action, with Budovsky sentenced to 20 years for money laundering.\nThese cases demonstrate that offering unlicensed banking services, minting private coins, or managing electronic gold accounts is effectively prohibited when it competes with the State. While closures had multiple reasons, it’s evident that serious alternatives to State monetary systems have been eliminated31.\n31 Lawrence H. White, “The Troubling Suppression of Competition from Alternative Monies,” Cato Journal, vol. 34, no. 2, 2014.32 Notably, PayPal’s original vision was revolutionary. CEO Peter Thiel stated in 1999: “PayPal will allow citizens around the world to exercise more direct control over their currencies than ever before. It will be practically impossible for corrupt governments to steal their citizens’ wealth by their old means…” — Eric M. Jackson, The PayPal Wars, 2012.Monetary monopolies are subtly enforced through counterfeiting and money laundering laws, leaving no legal alternatives. Innovations like PayPal or GoldMoney conform to regulations to survive32.\nState intervention aims to control monetary systems, destroying alternatives if necessary. Bitcoin was designed to resist this formidable force.",

Consequently, it claims control over money as its prerogative, especially since it derives income (seigniorage) from it. Over time, this control has become increasingly insidious, accelerating with banking’s rise during the Renaissance. Banknotes were co-opted by central banks, which monopolized their production, transforming them into fiat money. Similarly, bank deposits, now meticulously monitored, might soon be absorbed by central bank digital currencies.\nBelieving the State will relinquish its extraction methods or make them more transparent is unrealistic unless beneficiaries demand change. Smaller States might seem capable of reform, but dominant powers’ imperialistic ambitions hinder this. Running a server in a favorable jurisdiction isn’t sufficient for managing a digital currency, as Liberty Reserve’s case illustrates.\nThus, Bitcoin is designed to resist State intervention, attempting to build a robust alternative to current monetary systems. It achieves this by distributing operations across a peer-to-peer network of nodes. This equal distribution shares risks among participants, ensuring the system’s security relies on their combined economic actions rather than a single entity.",

    "text": "La cryptographie symétrique et l’ordinateur\nBitcoin est avant tout basé sur la communication, c’est-à-dire le fait de transmettre des informations à autrui. Cette communication a longtemps été restreinte géographiquement, du fait des limitations techniques qui caractérisaient les sociétés pré-industrielles. L’échange avec le lointain était très rare, ce qui expliquait l’existence de langues et de cultures distinctes.\nToutefois, l’évolution technique a modifié cet état des choses. À partir de la moitié du xix siècle, la télécommunication, ou la transmission d’information à distance, a connu un bond prodigieux. Ceci s’est fait d’abord grâce à l’apparition du télégraphe électrique, qui permettait d’envoyer et de recevoir des messages écrits (ou télégrammes) d’une manière rapide et fiable. Puis elle s’est renforcée avec l’arrivée du téléphone, qui donnait la possibilité de transférer des paroles à distance. En outre, la radiocommunication, basée sur l’usage des ondes radioélectriques pour partager de l’information, a rendu ces techniques beaucoup plus pratiques. Il est ainsi devenu possible de communiquer rapidement d’un continent à l’autre, chose qui a notamment profité aux États, qui pouvaient désormais gérer leurs territoires éloignés d’une manière plus fluide et centralisée.\nCette évolution de la télécommunication a considérablement accru le besoin de sécuriser l’information transmise, afin d’éviter qu’elle soit interceptée par l’ennemi lors d’une guerre par exemple. C’est pourquoi la cryptographie, qui existait depuis l’Antiquité, a connu un essor sans précédent au cours du xx siècle.\nLa cryptographie est la discipline mathématique qui a pour but la sécurisation de la communication en présence de tiers malveillants. À l’origine, il s’agit de dissimuler de l’information par une méthode de chiffrement, ce qui explique le mot, qui vient du grec ancien kruptós, kruptós (« caché ») et de gráfein, gráphein (« écrire »). Par la suite, la cryptographie s’est étendue à l’authentification de messages avec la signature numérique et à la vérification de données par l’intermédiaire des fonctions de hachage. En résumé, cette discipline permet d’assurer la confidentialité (chiffrement), l’authenticité (signature) et l’intégrité (hachage) de l’information transmise.\nLa cryptographie porte en elle la notion d’adversaire ou d’antagoniste (de l’anglais adversary) qui est une entité malveillante dont le but est d’empêcher les utilisateurs d’un cryptosystème de réaliser leurs objectifs. Il n’y a en effet pas besoin de cacher, d’authentifier ou de vérifier quoi que ce soit en l’absence d’une menace externe. C’est pour cette raison que le chiffrement et son pendant, la cryptanalyse, ont été développés en premier lieu par et pour les États.\nLe chiffrement est un procédé permettant de rendre impossible la compréhension d’un message pour les personnes qui ne disposent pas d’une information spécifique, appelée la clé de déchiffrement. La cryptanalyse est la technique visant à déduire un texte en clair à partir d’un message chiffré sans disposer de la clé.\nÀ l’origine, le chiffrement se fait uniquement de manière symétrique, c’est-à-dire que la clé de chiffrement et de déchiffrement sont les mêmes et que les deux parties doivent avoir connaissance de cette clé secrète pour communiquer. L’exemple typique de chiffrement symétrique est le code de César, ou chiffrement par décalage, qui est l’une des méthodes les plus simples et les plus connues pour chiffrer un texte. Le texte chiffré s’obtient en remplaçant chaque lettre du texte clair original par une lettre à distance fixe, toujours du même côté, dans l’ordre de l’alphabet. La clé est alors le nombre correspondant au décalage. Par exemple, un décalage de 21 lettres vers la droite transforme le mot « bitcoin » en « wdoxjdi ». Cette méthode tient son nom du fait que Jules César l’utilisait dans ses correspondances secrètes.\nLe chiffrement symétrique pose néanmoins un problème logistique. La clé doit en effet être transmise entre les deux parties qui communiquent et peut donc être interceptée. De plus, le nombre de clés à partager augmente de manière exponentielle en fonction du nombre de personnes impliquées (3 clés pour 2 personnes, 6 pour 3, 10 pour 4, etc.), ce qui multiplie considérablement les risques. C’est ce qui explique pourquoi l’apparition du chiffrement asymétrique, qui permettait de s’affranchir de cette contrainte, a constitué une innovation.\nLe développement du chiffrement a motivé la conception de machines de plus en plus perfectionnées. Le chiffrement correct d’un message à la main pouvait prendre des heures, de sorte que l’utilisation d’un automate devenait pertinente. Après la Première Guerre mondiale, durant laquelle la cryptologie avait joué un rôle clé notamment avec l’affaire du télégramme Zimmermann, les premières machines de chiffrement sont ainsi apparues à l’instar de la machine Enigma et des machines de Lorentz utilisées par l’Allemagne.\nAu cours de la Seconde Guerre, le besoin de cryptanalyse a poussé les belligérants à construire des machines à calculer programmables spécialisées, pouvant évaluer un grand nombre de possibilités dans un contexte précis. La Bombe de Turing et le Colossus ont ainsi été fabriqués par les services de cryptanalyse britanniques afin de casser les codes allemands. En parallèle, d’autres calculateurs (appelés computers en anglais) ont été développés dans le but de calculer les trajectoires balistiques. C’était le cas de la machine Zuse Z3 en Allemagne ou de l’Atanasoff–Berry Computer aux États-Unis. Le premier ordinateur au sens moderne du terme (Turing-complet, entièrement électronique, à mémoire enregistrée) a été l’ENIAC, qui a été conçu en 1945 par des ingénieurs de la Moore School of Electrical Engineering et dont l’architecture a été reprise en 1948 par le mathématicien américain John von Neumann.\nAprès la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les ordinateurs sont devenus progressivement plus efficaces grâce à l’invention du transistor (1947), du circuit intégré (1958) et du microprocesseur (1971). Ceci a débouché, au cours des années 1970, sur l’apparition de l’ordinateur personnel (personal computer), un ordinateur destiné à l’usage d’une personne et dont les dimensions sont assez réduites pour tenir sur un bureau. L’exemple le plus célèbre est sans doute l’Apple II, conçu par Steve Wozniak et sorti en 1977 qui est le premier ordinateur personnel fabriqué à grande échelle.\nLa développement des ordinateurs a naturellement coïncidé avec l’élaboration des premiers langages de programmation, compilés et interprétés : le FORTRAN est apparu en 1957, le LISP en 1958, le COBOL en 1959, le BASIC en 1964, et le C en 1972. Le langage C++, dans lequel Satoshi Nakamoto a écrit la première version du logiciel de Bitcoin, a fait son apparition plus tard, en 1985. Cette évolution a entraîné la démocratisation de la programmation informatique. Elle a aussi marqué le début de la sous-culture des hackers, axée sur la compréhension approfondie des systèmes informatiques et sur le détournement de leur rôle prédéfini.\nLes systèmes d’exploitation standards ont été conçus à partir des années 1970. Unix a été présenté par AT&T au public pour la première fois en 1973. DOS, l’ancêtre de Windows, a été créé en 1981. Le Système 1 d’Apple, adapté à ses ordinateurs Macintosh, a été lancé en 1984. Le système libre GNU/Linux a quant à lui été créé en 1991.",

    "text": "L’apparition de la cryptographie moderne\nLa deuxième avancée majeure dans l’histoire technique qui a mené à Bitcoin est l’apparition de la cryptographie moderne regroupant le chiffrement asymétrique, la signature numérique et le hachage de données. L’utilisation de plus en plus répandue des ordinateurs, notamment au sein des universités américaines, a poussé les cryptographes à imaginer des méthodes plus gourmandes en puissance de calcul, mais bien plus efficaces pour le chiffrement. La percée a été réalisée en 1976 lorsque les chercheurs Whitfield Diffie et Martin Hellman ont publié un article scientifique, intitulé New Directions in Cryptography, dans lequel ils décrivaient un algorithme d’échange de clés (destiné à la transmission des clés secrètes pour le chiffrement symétrique) ainsi qu’un procédé de signature électronique. L’introduction commençait comme suit :\n« Nous sommes aujourd’hui à la veille d’une révolution dans le domaine de la cryptographie. Le développement de matériel numérique bon marché a permis de s’affranchir des limites de conception de l’informatique mécanique et de ramener le coût des dispositifs cryptographiques de haute qualité à un niveau tel qu’ils peuvent être utilisés dans des applications commerciales telles que les distributeurs de billets distants et les terminaux d’ordinateurs. À leur tour, ces applications créent un besoin pour de nouveaux types de systèmes cryptographiques qui minimisent la nécessité de sécuriser les canaux de distribution des clés et fournissent l’équivalent d’une signature écrite. Dans le même temps, les développements théoriques de la théorie de l’information et de l’informatique promettent de fournir des cryptosystèmes dont la sécurité est prouvée, transformant ainsi cet art ancien en science1. »\n1 Whitfield Diffie et Martin Hellman, « New Directions in Cryptography », IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 22, no. 6, novembre 1976, pp. 644–654 : https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf.S’ils ont été les premiers à publier ces méthodes, ils n’ont pas été les seuls à faire ces découvertes au cours de la période. Clifford Cocks, James Ellis et Malcolm Williamson avaient déjà mis au point un tel cryptosystème quelques années plus tôt (qu’ils appelaient le « chiffrement non secret ») pour le compte du GCHQ britannique, mais leurs recherches sont restées classifiées. Le cryptographe Ralph Merkle avait également décrit l’échange de clés de Diffie et Hellman dans un article écrit en 1974 et publié en 1978 par l’intermédiaire de ce qu’on appelle les puzzles de Merkle.\nL’avancée de Diffie et Hellman a marqué le début de la cryptographie asymétrique, ou cryptographie à clé publique, une discipline qui regroupe le chiffrement asymétrique et la signature numérique. Dans un système asymétrique, deux clés se distinguent : une clé privée, censée rester secrète, et une clé publique, dérivée de la clé privée. La clé privée ne peut pas être retrouvée facilement à partir de la clé publique, ce qui fait que cette dernière peut être partagée à tous en toute quiétude.\nLe chiffrement asymétrique consiste à utiliser la clé publique comme une clé de chiffrement et la clé privée comme une clé de déchiffrement. Le destinataire génère une paire de clés, garde la clé privée pour lui et partage la clé publique à son interlocuteur pour qu’il lui envoie des messages. Le fonctionnement de ce chiffrement est ainsi analogue à celui d’une boîte aux lettres que le destinataire utilise pour recevoir des lettres et dont lui seul possède la clé.\nLa signature numérique quant à elle, repose sur le fait d’utiliser la clé privée comme une clé de signature et la clé publique comme clé de vérification. L’expéditeur signe un message à l’aide de la clé privée et l’envoie à son interlocuteur, qui peut vérifier son authenticité en utilisant la clé publique.\nLe système cryptographique asymétrique le plus connu a été conçu juste après la publication du papier de Diffie et Hellman : il s’agit de l’algorithme de chiffrement RSA, créé en 1977 par Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir et Leonard Adleman et breveté par le MIT en 1983. Celui-ci se base sur des opérations algébriques et sa sécurité provient de la difficulté à décomposer de très grands nombres en facteurs premiers. Il permet de chiffrer un message pour l’envoyer à quelqu’un, mais aussi (grâce à l’interversion des rôles des clés) de signer électroniquement ce message pour le publier. Cet algorithme est encore aujourd’hui utilisé très largement sur Internet, et en particulier dans le commerce électronique.\nDu côté du chiffrement, d’autres algorithmes ont été conçus par le suite. C’était le cas de l’algorithme de chiffrement d’ElGamal qui a été présenté par Taher ElGamal en 1984, et dont la fiabilité reposait sur le problème du logarithme discret, c’est-à-dire la difficulté mathématique à retrouver l’exposant d’un élément dans un groupe cyclique fini2.\n2 Soit \\(G = (\\mathbb{Z}_n^*, \\cdot)\\) un groupe cyclique fini et soit \\(g\\) un point générateur. Le problème du logarithme discret consiste, pour \\(x \\in G\\), à retrouver \\(k &lt; n\\) tel que \\(x = g^k\\). On écrit alors \\(\\mathrm{log}_g (x) = k\\).Du côté de la signature, des algorithmes destinés à servir uniquement à cet usage ont été également développés. C’était le cas du modèle d’ElGamal, qu’il a présenté en même temps que son système de chiffrement en 1984, du schéma de signature de Schnorr, conceptualisé par Claus-Peter Schnorr en 1991, et du Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), conçu la même année par le NIST. Tous les trois se basaient aussi sur le problème du logarithme discret.\nLa cryptographie sur courbes elliptiques est apparue en 1985 grâce aux contributions indépendantes de Neal Koblitz et de Victor Miller. Elle a amené un bon nombre d’innovations, dont le procédé d’échange de clés ECDH et l’algorithme de chiffrement hybride ECIES. Le schéma de signature ECDSA, qui est l’algorithme principal utilisé dans Bitcoin pour autoriser les transferts, a été créé en 1992.\nLa cryptographie asymétrique ouvrait également la voie aux fonctions à sens unique, des fonctions dont le calcul d’une image est facile mais dont l’obtention d’un antécédent est difficile. En effet, les systèmes de chiffrement à clé publique pouvaient former eux-mêmes des fonctions de ce type. De ce fait, la recherche dans la découverte de telles fonctions s’est développée à partir de cette base.\nOn a assisté en particulier au développement des premières fonctions de hachage cryptographiques, dont les premiers modèles datent de la fin des années 1970. Ces fonctions avaient pour particularité de transformer un message de taille variable en une empreinte de taille fixe. Entre 1989 et 1991, plusieurs algorithmes de hachage (MD2, MD4, MD5) ont été conçus par Ronald Rivest pour le MIT. Puis, l’algorithme SHA-0 a été créé en 1993 et SHA-1 en 1995. La suite d’algorithmes SHA-2, qui incluait le fameux SHA-256 largement utilisé dans Bitcoin, a été publiée en 2001.\nEn parallèle, les idées pour l’utilisation de ces fonctions de hachage ont fleuri. Ces dernières permettaient de garantir l’intégrité de l’information de façon à ce que tout changement soit détecté en sortie. En 1979, Ralph Merkle a mis au point les arbres de hachage qui permettaient d’authentifier un ensemble volumineux de données, auxquels il a donné son nom. Ces arbres ont également été inclus dans la conception originelle de Bitcoin3.\n3 Les détails concernant l’utilisation de ces éléments cryptographiques (ECDSA, SHA-256, arbres de Merkle) dans Bitcoin seront discutés dans les chapitres 7 et 8.",

    "text": "L’usage civil de la cryptographie\nCes découvertes de la cryptographie moderne ont inspiré les esprits libres, qui ont tout de suite imaginé les applications qui pouvaient en découler. En quelques années, un vaste domaine d’études venait d’être ouvert dans le monde civil, et beaucoup d’individus allaient s’y engouffrer.\nC’était le cas de David Chaum, informaticien et cryptographe américain, né en 1955 dans une famille juive à Los Angeles et étudiant à l’université de Californie à Berkeley, qui s’est vite pris de passion pour la protection de la vie privée. À partir de 1979, ce dernier a contribué de manière primordiale au monde de la cryptographie par la publication d’articles fondateurs. En 1981, il publiait l’article Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms4, où il décrivait les bases de la communication anonyme au travers de réseaux de mélange (mix networks), qui serait notamment utilisée par les services de relai de courriel (Mixmaster) et par les réseaux anonymes Tor, I2P et Freenet. En 1982, il décrivait le procédé de signature aveugle, qui permettait notamment de mettre en place une monnaie électronique anonyme5, que Chaum mettrait en œuvre quelques années plus tard via sa société DigiCash, ainsi que l’émission de certificats automatiques, utilisée par exemple dans ZeroLink aujourd’hui. Durant la même année, il a également publié sa thèse de doctorat écrite en 1979, qui présentait un système de coffres cryptographiques ayant pour but d’arriver à un consensus au sein d’un ensemble d’acteurs ne se faisant pas confiance. En 1985, il a publié un protocole permettant de résoudre le problème du dîner des cryptographes en garantissant l’anonymat de l’auteur d’un message partagé au sein d’un groupe6.\n4 David L. Chaum, « Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms », in Communications of the ACM, vol. 24, no. 2, 1981, pp. 84—90.5 David L. Chaum, « Blind signatures for untraceable payments », in Advances in Cryptology: Proceedings of CRYPTO ’82, 1982, pp. 199–203 : https://sceweb.sce.uhcl.edu/yang/teaching/csci5234WebSecurityFall2011/Chaum-blind-signatures.PDF.6 David L. Chaum, « Security without identification: transaction systems to make big brother obsolete », in Communications of the ACM, vol. 28, no. 10, octobre 1985, pp. 1030—1044 : https://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/pub/secsem/chaum1985bigbrother.pdf.David Chaum était obsédé par la protection de la vie privée, qu’il estimait être en danger. Même si cette obsession n’atteignait pas la radicalité des cypherpunks (dont il en était un précurseur), il n’en restait pas moins qu’il était très inquiet pour l’avenir de la liberté et de la confidentialité dans la société informatisée. En juillet 1995, il déclarait ainsi devant la Chambre des représentants des États-Unis :\n« Les “techniques de protection de la vie privée” permettent aux individus de protéger leurs propres informations et leurs intérêts, tout en assurant un niveau de sécurité très élevé aux organisations. Il s’agit essentiellement de faire la différence entre, d’une part, un système centralisé dans lequel les participants sont privés de leurs droits (comme des animaux marqués électroniquement dans des fermes d’engraissement) et, d’autre part, un système dans lequel chaque participant est en mesure de protéger ses propres intérêts (comme les acheteurs et les vendeurs sur une place de marché)7. »\n7 David L. Chaum, Testimony for US House of Representatives, 25 juillet 1995, archive : https://web.archive.org/web/19970111170802/http://digicash.com/publish/testimony.html.8 Martin Gardner, « Mathematical Games: A new kind of cipher that would take millions of years to break », in Scientific American, août 1977 : https://simson.net/ref/1977/Gardner_RSA.pdf.Un autre exemple était Philip Zimmermann, informaticien et cryptographe américain originaire de Philadelphie et ayant fait ses études en Floride. Activiste politique opposé aux armes nucléaires, il avait travaillé pour la Nuclear Weapons Freeze Campaign à Boulder dans le Colorado. Passionné par les énigmes et les secrets, il a découvert l’existence de la cryptographie asymétrique par le biais d’un article de Martin Gardner8. Il a publié un article dans la revue IEEE Computer en 1986 sur RSA avant de concevoir PGP.\nPGP (de l’anglais Pretty Good Privacy) était un logiciel de chiffrement hybride, qui se basait sur RSA pour l’échange de clés et sur un algorithme de chiffrement symétrique pour la communication. Il permettait aussi de générer des signatures. Il était spécialisé dans l’échange de courriels9.\n9 L’algorithme de chiffrement symétrique dans la version 1 était BassOmatic, conçu par Zimmermann lui-même. Il a été remplacé par IDEA dans la version 2 et les versions supérieures. La version 3 ajoutait les algorithmes ElGamal et DSA pour la partie asymétrique, et l’algorithme CAST-128 pour le côté symétrique.Le 5 juin 1991, Phil Zimmermann en a publié la version 1.0 sous licence libre. Dans le manuel d’utilisation il expliquait sa démarche :\n« Si la confidentialité est interdite, seuls les hors-la-loi en bénéficieront. Les agences de renseignement ont accès à des techniques cryptographiques performantes. Il en va de même pour les grands trafiquants d’armes et de drogue, ainsi que pour les entreprises de défense, les compagnies pétrolières et les autres géants de l’industrie. En revanche, les citoyens ordinaires et les associations politiques locales n’ont généralement pas accès à des techniques de cryptographie à clé publique “de qualité militaire” à un prix abordable. PGP permet aux gens de prendre en main leur vie privée. La société en a de plus en plus besoin. C’est pourquoi je l’ai conçu10. »\n10 Philip R. Zimmermann, « Why do you need PGP? », in PGP User’s Guide, 5 juin 1991 : https://www.tech-insider.org/free-software/research/acrobat/910605.pdf.Il a diffusé la première version de PGP depuis les États-Unis par l’intermédiaire d’Internet ce qui fait que, en raison de la nature internationale du réseau, le logiciel de chiffrement est rapidement devenu disponible dans le monde entier. En faisant cela, Zimmermann était conscient qu’il risquait d’attiser une réponse du pouvoir : la Réglementation américaine sur le trafic d’armes au niveau international (International Traffic in Arms Regulations ou ITAR) considérait en effet les produits cryptographiques comme des « munitions » et en interdisait l’exportation sans licence. En février 1993, alors que PGP commençait à se populariser, une enquête contre Zimmermann a par conséquent été ouverte par l’État fédéral. Heureusement cette enquête a été abandonnée quelques années plus tard, notamment suite à la réaction des cypherpunks, dont Zimmermann est toutefois resté à l’écart (à l’instar de Chaum).\nEnfin, les scientifiques Stuart Haber et Scott Stornetta ont aussi été inspirés par ces découvertes. Stuart Haber était cryptographe et informaticien, Scott Stornetta était physicien et chercheur. Les deux hommes se sont rencontrés dans les locaux de Bell Communications Research (« Bellcore »), un consortium de recherche et développement dans la télécommunication pour lequel ils travaillaient.\nIls ont conceptualisé le premier système d’horodatage de documents dans l’article How to time-stamp a digital document publié en 1991, et qui a plus tard été cité au sein du livre blanc de Bitcoin11. Il s’agissait d’appliquer une fonction de hachage (par exemple MD4) à un document numérique et de publier l’empreinte résultante dans un registre public, de sorte à prouver l’existence du document à une date donnée. Ils ont mis leur idée en application par la publication d’empreintes dans les petites annonces du New York Times à partir de 1992. Ils ont ensuite créé leur propre société en 1994, Surety Technologies, dans le but de se consacrer pleinement à cette activité. Ils sont ainsi connus pour avoir créé la première chaîne temporelle d’horodatages, préfigurant la chaîne de blocs de Bitcoin, en incluant l’empreinte précédente dans le calcul de la nouvelle empreinte à publier dans le journal12.\n11 Stuart Haber, Wakefield Scott Stornetta, « How to time-stamp a digital document », in Journal of Cryptology, vol. 3, 1991, pp. 99–111 : http://www.staroceans.org/e-book/Haber_Stornetta.pdf.12 Daniel Oberhaus, The World’s Oldest Blockchain Has Been Hiding in the New York Times Since 1995, 27 août 2018 : https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5nzx4/what-was-the-first-blockchain.De manière générale, tous ces individus ont, par leur compréhension de la cryptographie asymétrique, largement préfiguré les cypherpunks. Ces derniers ont été cependant bien plus loin en radicalisant les idées politiques qu’esquissaient ces techniques mathématiques.",

    "text": "L’émergence d’Internet et le partage de données\nAvec l’émergence des ordinateurs est venue la volonté de les connecter en réseau. C’est ainsi que les premiers réseaux informatiques se sont formés dans les années 50. Mais ces réseaux n’étaient pas interconnectés. Pour cela, il a fallu attendre un effort public et ouvert, qui a été fait à partir des années 70, par l’intermédiaire du développement du réseau des réseaux international : Internet.\nL’idée derrière Internet était de transmettre des paquets de données (et plus spécifiquement des datagrammes) par le biais d’une technique nommée la commutation de paquets, initialement décrite en 1964 par l’informaticien polono-américain Paul Baran13. Cette technique consistait à indiquer la destination dans l’en-tête des paquets de sorte à ce qu’il puissent être relayés sur le réseau, notamment au moyen de routeurs. Elle s’opposait à la commutation de circuits, qui reposait sur une liaison déterminée entre l’expéditeur et le destinataire pour transmettre les données. À l’époque, les communications transitaient au travers des lignes téléphoniques au moyen d’un modem.\n13 Paul Baran, « On Distributed Communications Networks », in IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems, vol. 12, no. 1, mars 1964, pp. 1–9 : https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/cs217/Baran64.pdf.\n\n\nRéseaux : (a) centralisé ; (b) décentralisé ; (c) distribué. (Paul Baran, « On Distributed Communications Networks », 1964)\n\n\nLe premier réseau d’Internet tire son origine dans la recherche militaire. Il s’agissait du réseau ARPANET, conçu par l’ARPA, une agence de recherche technique rattachée au département de la Défense14. Le but était de développer un réseau de communication qui puisse résister aux attaques nucléaires dans le cadre de la Guerre froide. Par la suite, d’autres réseaux se sont développés de manière similaire dans le monde militaro-universitaire comme le réseau du NPL au Royaume-Uni, le Merit Network aux États-Unis ou le réseau Cyclades en France.\n14 L’ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency, « Agence pour les projets de recherche avancée ») a été créée en 1958. Elle a été rebaptisée DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, « Agence pour les projets de recherche avancée de défense ») en 1972. Elle est brièvement redevenue l’ARPA en 1993 avant d’adopter définitivement le nom de DARPA en 1996.15 Vinton G. Cerf, Robert E. Kahn, « A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication », in IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 22, no. 5, mai 1974, pp. 637–648 : https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/cerf74.pdf.Le concept proprement dit d’Internet est apparu en 1974, avec l’émergence d’une suite de protocoles facilitant l’interconnexion des réseaux : la suite TCP/IP15. Ces protocoles permettaient de standardiser la communication des paquets. La standardisation a été finalisée avec la publication de la version 4 de IP et de la version 4 de TCP en 1981, et avec leur intégration dans ARPANET (le réseau fédérateur d’Internet) en 1983. En 1985, a été créé le NSFNET, qui a rapidement pris de l’ampleur, à tel point qu’il a remplacé ARPANET en tant que réseau fédérateur. Le projet ARPANET a été officiellement mis hors service en 1990. Mais on pouvait considérer qu’Internet était alors lancé.\nInternet a provoqué un choc sans précédent sur la possibilité de diffusion des informations. Toutefois, son développement et son adoption ont été progressifs, à mesure que les gens estimaient son potentiel et son utilité. Cette croissance est passée par l’apparition de cas d’utilisation diverses qui ont amené de plus en plus de gens à utiliser le réseau des réseaux.\nLe courrier électronique a été la première application d’Internet. Au début, il s’agissait d’envoyer des textes par l’intermédiaire du protocole FTP, puis des protocoles spécifiques ont été développés dans les années 80. Le premier courriel a été envoyé en 1971. Les listes de diffusion sont également apparues rapidement avec le développement de logiciels permettant d’envoyer le même message à un ensemble de personnes. Le logiciel LISTSERV est ainsi sorti en 1986, Majordomo en 1992, GNU Mailman en 1999.\nUn autre cas d’utilisation est l’émergence de forums de discussions, qui permettaient aux gens de discuter publiquement de sujets spécifiques. Usenet, un réseau de forums de discussion, a ainsi été lancé en 1980 et est devenu entièrement compatible avec Internet en 1986. L’utilisateur y accédait par un logiciel appelé un lecteur de nouvelles. Usenet a été très populaire à la fin des années 80 et au cours des années 90, notamment grâce aux universités. C’est de Usenet que provient le concept de « septembre éternel », qui fait référence au mois de septembre 1993, durant lequel de nombreux nouveaux utilisateurs étaient arrivés, faisant drastiquement baisser la qualité du discours, tant au niveau du fond que de la forme16. Usenet a été la cause du développement des premiers fournisseurs d’accès à Internet (FAI), qui permettaient à leurs clients d’y accéder sans restrictions, sans matériel nécessaire, contre le paiement d’un abonnement. Notons enfin que Usenet a été cité par Satoshi Nakamoto dans le livre blanc de Bitcoin et dans plusieurs de ses messages, ce qui témoigne de son influence dans la cyberculture.\n16 « Le mois de septembre 1993 entrera dans l’histoire du net comme le mois de septembre qui n’a jamais pris fin. » – Dave Fischer, Re: longest USENET thread ever, 26/01/1994 01:58:52 UTC : https://groups.google.com/g/alt.folklore.computers/c/wF4CpYbWuuA/m/jS6ZOyJd10sJ.C’est également à cette époque qu’est apparu le protocole de communication textuelle IRC (pour Internet Relay Chat), qui permettait à des individus d’échanger des messages en temps réel.\nMais l’évènement vraiment déterminant dans le développement d’Internet a été l’arrivée du Web, qui a réellement encouragé l’afflux du grand public. Celui-ci a été conçu en 1989 par le chercheur Tim Berners-Lee pour le compte du CERN, qui a été aidé par l’ingénieur Robert Cailliau pour en définir les spécificités. Le modèle a été finalement rendu public en août 1991.\nLe World Wide Web, abrégé communément en Web, et parfois appelé « la Toile » en français, est un système hypertexte public fonctionnant sur Internet, c’est-à-dire un système permettant de passer d’une page à l’autre (via des hyperliens) sans devoir revenir à la racine. Même si l’idée n’était pas nouvelle (le concept d’hypertexte avait été inventé par Ted Nelson en 1965, dans le cadre de son projet Xanadu), le Web innovait par trois caractéristiques : les adresses sous forme d’URL, le protocole de communication HTTP, et le langage informatique HTML.\nL’accès à la Toile se faisait par le biais d’un navigateur Web développé par Berners-Lee, baptisé WorldWideWeb, qui ne constituait guère plus qu’une preuve de concept. Ainsi, le Web n’a vraiment décollé que grâce aux navigateurs Mosaic, créé en 1993, et surtout Netscape, conçu en 1994. Le Web a engendré un engouement sans précédent, notamment grâce à l’idée du commerce électronique. Cela a finalement abouti à une bulle financière appelée la bulle Internet (que les anglophones nomment la dot-com bubble), qui a éclaté en mars 2000.\nLes années 2000 ont aussi été marquées par le développement du partage de fichiers en pair-à-pair. En 1999, Napster permettait de partager de la musique avec d’autres utilisateurs. Néanmoins, il reposait sur un serveur central pour référencer les fichiers, ce qui l’a contraint à fermer en 2001 sous la pression de la RIAA, l’association représentant l’industrie du disque aux États-Unis.\nAfin de résoudre ce problème, des protocoles purement pair à pair sont apparus. Il s’agissait de créer un réseau où tous les ordinateurs (appelés nœuds) possédaient le même niveau de privilège, par opposition au modèle client-serveur, de sorte qu’il n’y ait plus de point de défaillance unique à attaquer pour faire cesser le partage. C’était le cas de Gnutella et de eDonkey, tous deux créés en 2000. Mais surtout c’était le cas de BitTorrent, dont la première version a été publiée en 200117. Ces protocoles formaient une alternative beaucoup plus fiable puisqu’il fallait poursuivre chaque utilisateur individuellement, ce qui représentait une charge considérable pour l’État.\n17 Bram Cohen, BitTorrent - a new P2P app, 2 juillet 2001, archive : https://web.archive.org/web/20080129085545/http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/decentralization/message/3160.18 David M. Goldschlag, Michael G. Reed, Paul F. Syverson, « Hiding Routing Information », in Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Information Hiding, mai 1996, pp. 137—150 : https://www.onion-router.net/Publications/IH-1996.pdf.Une dernière innovation a été le routage en ognon qui venait ajouter de la confidentialité dans la transmission de données. Le routage en ognon a été inventé en 1996 par Paul Syverson, aux côtés de David Goldschlag et Michael Reed, pour le compte du Naval Research Laboratory, un laboratoire de recherche rattaché à la Navy18. Les trois hommes avaient pour mission de construire un réseau de mélange pour protéger les communications des agences étasuniennes. La mise en œuvre de cette technique a été réalisée quelques années plus tard, par le biais du réseau Tor, dont le nom est l’acronyme de The Onion Router et qui a été lancé en 2002 grâce à une subvention de la DARPA. Il a été rendu public en 2003, afin d’agrandir l’ensemble d’anonymat dans lequel pouvaient se fondre les communications fédérales. Cela avait l’avantage de créer un réseau anonyme dans lequel pouvaient œuvrer les hors-la-loi.\nInternet, et plus particulièrement le partage de pair à pair et le routage en ognon, semblaient donner la possibilité aux gens de continuer leurs activités malgré la réticence des autorités en charge, de sorte qu’elles ont inspiré la conception originelle de Bitcoin. Par son architecture distribuée, le réseau permettait de répartir les risques pour ne pas subir une attaque qui puisse mettre le système à genoux. Satoshi écrivait ainsi dans son courriel du 6 novembre 2008 :\n« Les États sont bons pour couper les têtes des réseaux contrôlés de manière centralisée comme Napster, mais les réseaux purement pair à pair comme Gnutella et Tor semblent tenir le coup19. »\n19 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper, 06/11/2008 20:15:40 UTC : https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014823.html.",

    "text": "La philosophie du logiciel libre\nLa possibilité de diffusion des informations apportée par l’émergence d’Internet a remis au goût du jour la critique à l’encontre de la « propriété intellectuelle », c’est-à-dire du monopole intellectuel exercé par certaines personnes sur certaines idées. En effet, il devenait facile d’accéder à l’information et de la propager ce qui rendait l’application de cette propriété beaucoup plus complexe. De ce fait, pour un certain nombre de personnes, les restrictions liées à ce monopole paraissaient totalement absurdes.\nLe « propriété intellectuelle » est un privilège accordé à un acteur économique sur une production de l’esprit, qui peut être une invention industrielle (auquel cas on parle de brevet) ou une création littéraire ou artistique (auquel cas on parle de droit d’auteur). Il ne s’agit pas simplement d’autoriser l’auteur d’une invention ou d’une œuvre à l’utiliser ou à la diffuser ; il s’agit d’interdire à tous les autres de l’utiliser ou de la diffuser sans son autorisation.\nLe monopole intellectuel est par essence contraire au droit naturel en raison de l’absence de rareté liée à l’information20. Pour le dire autrement, copier n’est pas voler. Thomas Jefferson, qui a pourtant participé à l’établissement du bureau américain des brevets, écrivait ainsi en 1813 :\n20 N. Stephan Kinsella, « Against Intellectual Property », in Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 15, no. 2, 2001, pp. 1–53 : https://cdn.mises.org/Against%20Intellectual%20Property_2.pdf.21 Thomas Jefferson, Letter to Isaac McPherson, 13 août 1813 : https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html.« Celui qui reçoit une idée de moi reçoit un savoir sans diminuer le mien ; tout comme celui qui allume sa bougie à la mienne reçoit la lumière sans me plonger dans la pénombre21. »\nLe monopole intellectuel permet à des personnes de toucher des redevances sans avoir signé un quelconque contrat avec celui qui les paie. Il encourage la consolidation de l’activité économique au sein de grandes entreprises. Dans le domaine informatique, il a permis à des sociétés de devenir de grands empires reposant sur le paiement de licences de leurs logiciels « propriétaires ». L’exemple le plus parlant est celui de Bill Gates et de son entreprise Microsoft. Il permet de contrôler l’utilisation d’une œuvre, et par conséquent d’influencer la culture d’une société.\nLa manière légale de s’opposer à cet ensemble de privilèges dans l’informatique a été l’émergence des licences libres. Celles-ci permettaient de prendre l’adversaire à son propre jeu en publiant un contenu sous une licence interdisant à quiconque de se l’approprier ou de l’inclure dans un contenu non libre. Ces licences ont émergé dans le cadre du développement logiciel, qui était soumis au droit d’auteur aux États-Unis.\nLe mouvement a été initié dans les années 80 par Richard Stallman, un physicien ayant grandi à New York et ayant étudié à Harvard. Ce dernier avait travaillé pour le département de recherche en intelligence artificielle au MIT où il avait été introduit à la culture des hackers et fait l’expérience des problématiques posées par les licences dans le cadre du développement du langage LISP.\nIl a fondé le projet GNU en 1983 dans le but de concevoir une alternative entièrement libre au système d’exploitation UNIX. Le projet a été lancé par un courriel diffusé sur le forum Usenet net.unix-wizards. En 1985, il écrivait le manifeste GNU22 et fondait la Free Software Foundation, ce qui marquait la naissance du mouvement du logiciel libre, et de la mouvance libriste en général.\n22 Richard M. Stallman, The GNU Manifesto, mars 1985 : https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html.Richard Stallman a formellement décrit la notion de logiciel libre pour la première fois en 1986, au sein du premier bulletin d’informations de GNU, qu’il réduisait à deux libertés de base :\n« Premièrement, la liberté de copier un programme et de le redistribuer à vos voisins, qu’ils puissent ainsi l’utiliser aussi bien que vous. Deuxièmement, la liberté de modifier un programme, que vous puissiez le contrôler plutôt qu’il vous contrôle ; pour cela, le code doit vous être accessible23. »\n23 Richard M. Stallman, What is the Free Software Foundation?, février 1986 : https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull1.txt.Il a par la suite raffiné cette définition pour qu’elle inclue quatre libertés fondamentales : la liberté d’utiliser le code dans n’importe quel but, la liberté de l’étudier et de le modifier, la liberté de le distribuer sans restriction et la liberté d’en distribuer des versions modifiées.\nDeux types de licences libres se sont distingués : le type permissif, et le type contaminant dit copyleft. Le premier type de licence exigeait que le code soit librement utilisable, copiable, distribuable et modifiable tout en permettant la réutilisation dans un programme non libre. Le second type était encore plus restrictif et imposait à tout programme utilisant le code d’être publié sous la même licence.\nLa première licence libre a été la licence MIT, qui a été développée par le Massachusetts Institute of Technology à partir de 1985. Licence permissive, elle était initialement présente au sein du protocole de fenêtrage X Window System développé conjointement avec la DEC et IBM. Une version standarde a été publiée en 1987 (X11), puis sa version finale a été publiée en 1998 pour être utilisée pour la bibliothèque Expat.\nUne autre licence permissive à apparaître rapidement a été la licence BSD, dont la première version a été publiée en 1988 pour distribuer, comme son nom l’indique, le code du système d’exploitation BSD. Plusieurs variantes de cette licence ont été publiées au cours des années : la licence BSD proprement dite, à 4 clauses, en 1990 ; la licence BSD modifiée, à 3 clauses, en 1999 ; la licence FreeBSD, à 2 clauses, en 1999 également ; et la licence BSD à zéro clause en 2013.\nLa première licence contaminante (copyleft) a été la GNU General Public License, plus connue sous l’abréviation de GPL, qui a été créée par Richard Stallman en février 1989. Une version 2 a été partagée en 1991 et une version 3 en 2007.\nLa notion d’open source ou de code source ouvert n’est venue qu’après, avec l’invention du terme par Christine Peterson en 1998 et l’implication d’Eric Steven Raymond. Le terme se rapportait à l’origine seulement au logiciel libre, dans le but de lever l’ambiguïté de l’appellation « free software » en anglais (free signifie à la fois libre et gratuit). Mais il a fini par désigner tous les logiciels dont le code source était disponible publiquement, qu’ils soient publiés sous licence libre ou non.\nLe code du prototype de Bitcoin (v0.1) a été publié en 2009 sous licence MIT. Pour un tel système ouvert, il était en effet nécessaire que le code soit ouvert. De plus, dans le but de réduire au maximum le contrôle sur le protocole, il fallait que le logiciel soit libre, comme nous l’expliquerons dans les chapitres 10 et 11.",

    "text": "La tendance extropienne\nL’évolution technique prodigieuse qui s’est produite durant le xx siècle, et qui ne s’est pas cantonnée à l’informatique et à la cryptographie, a fait évoluer la vision du monde des gens et la façon dont ils envisageaient l’avenir. Le développement de procédés de plus en plus avancés faisait entrevoir des possibilités inédites pour l’homme, comme l’amélioration de ses capacités, la conception de machines perfectionnées, la production de substances psychotropes, le voyage spatial et la création de mondes virtuels. C’est ce qui a mené à la fondation du mouvement des extropiens au sein de la Silicon Valley à la fin des années 80.\nL’extropianisme était une philosophie transhumaniste libérale optimiste, qui préconisait l’utilisation proactive de la technique en vue d’accroître les capacités humaines individuelles et civilisationnelles. Cette tendance se fondait sur l’extropie, un terme créé pour l’occasion pour désigner le principe d’organisation qui s’oppose à l’entropie et qui forme la base de la vie matérielle24. Le cœur de l’extropianisme était ainsi la survie et la prospérité dans un univers matériel souvent hostile, résolument entropique et finalement mortel.\n24 En thermodynamique, l’entropie est une grandeur physique qui caractérise le degré de désorganisation d’un système physique. Le deuxième principe de la thermodynamique énonce que l’entropie d’un système isolé croît avec le temps, ce qui implique que l’entropie de l’univers croît à mesure de son vieillissement, et qu’il finira par mourir. L’extropie se rapproche ainsi de la néguentropie, la baisse locale d’entropie à certains endroits, sans être définie de façon aussi formelle.25 Don Lavoie, Howard Baetjer, William Tulloh, « High-Tech Hayekians: Some Possible Research Topics in the Economics of Computation », in Market Process, vol. 8, 1990 : http://www.philsalin.com/hth/hth.html.Les extropiens ont été précédés par des individus qui ont par la suite été présentés comme des « high-tech hayekians25 », dont l’économiste et futuriste Phil Salin, le pionnier des nanotechnologies Eric Drexler et l’informaticien et programmeur Mark S. Miller. Ceux-ci adhéraient au principe de l’ordre spontané – selon lequel le laissez-faire aboutit à un ordre supérieur à celui décrété par une autorité constructiviste – qui avait été développé par les économistes de l’école autrichienne et qui avait été spécialement mis en valeur par le prix Nobel d’économie Friedrich Hayek. Ayant assisté à l’accélération de la propagation de l’information apportée par le développement d’Internet, ils anticipaient l’ordre nouveau qui allait en résulter. Ils ont cherché à construire des systèmes qui s’inscrivaient dans cette évolution, comme l’American Information Exchange (AMIX), une place de marché automatisée dédiée à l’information, et le projet Agorics, un modèle d’échange de calcul informatique.\nLe mouvement extropien a, lui, été fondé en janvier 1988 par Max T. O’Connor (futur Max More) et Tom W. Bell (aussi connu sous le nom de Tom Morrow), deux étudiants en philosophie de l’Université de Californie du Sud qui partageaient la même passion pour l’anticipation futuriste de l’évolution du monde. Au cours de l’automne 88, ils ont lancé un magazine appelé Extropy, dans lequel ils présentaient leur doctrine de manière détaillée et autour duquel le mouvement s’est ensuite construit. Une liste de diffusion a été mise en place durant l’été 1991 par Perry Metzger, par l’intermédiaire de laquelle les extropiens pouvaient échanger par courriel sur des sujets divers. Les extropiens présents dans la région de la baie de San Francisco ne manquaient pas non plus de se rencontrer dans la vraie vie, au moyen de ce qu’ils appelaient des Extropaganzas. Un institut, appelé l’Extropy Institute, a aussi été fondé en mai 1992 dans le but de faire la promotion des principes extropiens. La première conférence organisée par l’institut, nommée « Extro 1 », a eu lieu en avril 1994 à Sunnyvale dans la Silicon Valley. Elle faisait notamment intervenir, outre Max More et Tom Bell, le spécialiste en robotique Hans Moravec et le cryptographe Ralph Merkle. Cette conférence a été relatée au cours de l’automne par le magazine Wired, jetant un peu de lumière sur le mouvement26.\n26 Ed Regis, Meet the Extropians, 1 octobre 1994 : https://www.wired.com/1994/10/extropians/.27 Max More, « The Extropian Principles », in Extropy, vol. 6, 1 juillet 1990 : https://github.com/Extropians/Extropy/blob/master/ext6.pdf.Rationaliste, cette doctrine reposait sur quatre principes, définis en 1990 : l’expansion illimitée, l’auto-transformation, l’optimisme dynamique et la technologie intelligente27. L’extropianisme représentait ainsi un transhumanisme, une volonté de transcender la nature humaine, déjà envisagée auparavant par des personnes comme Julian Huxley, Robert Ettinger et FM-2030.\nLa philosophie extropienne n’était pas seulement descriptive, mais prescriptive. Conformément au principe de l’optimisme dynamique (ou pragmatique), les extropiens souhaitaient intervenir pour accélérer l’avènement de l’avenir qu’ils anticipaient. Ils promouvaient ainsi la recherche et l’expérimentation dans les domaines scientifiques qui avaient pour but d’améliorer la condition matérielle de l’homme.\nD’abord, dans leur lutte contre la mort, les extropiens étaient en particulier enthousiastes à propos de la cryogénisation, c’est-à-dire de la conservation à très basse température de corps de défunts dans l’espoir de les ressusciter grâce à un futur progrès technique. L’Alcor Life Extension Foundation, fondée en 1972 par Fred Chamberlain iii et sa femme, basée en Arizona, était la principale organisation qui prenait en charge ce type de service.\nLes extropiens étaient également ouvertement hostiles à l’autorité. Ils promouvaient le principe de l’ordre spontané, décentralisé par nature, par opposition au technocratisme centralisé, qu’ils considéraient comme ralentissant le progrès technique28. Certains extropiens s’inspiraient notamment de l’ouvrage de David Friedman The Machinery of Freedom, qui décrivait comment pouvait s’organiser une société sans État et dont la seconde édition a été publiée en 1989.\n28 « Le progrès durable et la prise de décision intelligente et rationnelle requièrent des sources d’information et des points de vue diversifiés, rendus possibles par les ordres spontanés. La gestion centralisée limite l’exploration, la diversité, la liberté et les opinions divergentes. Respecter l’ordre spontané, c’est soutenir les institutions volontaristes qui maximisent l’autonomie, par opposition aux groupements hiérarchiques rigides et autoritaires, qui se caractérisent par leur structure bureaucratique, la suppression de l’innovation et de la diversité, et l’étouffement des incitations individuelles. Notre compréhension des ordres spontanés nous rend très méfiants à l’égard des “autorités” qui nous sont imposées, et sceptiques à l’égard des dirigeants politiques, de l’obéissance inconditionnelle et des traditions non remises en question. » – Max More, « The Extropian Principles v. 2.0 », Extropy, vol. 9, 1992 : https://github.com/Extropians/Extropy/blob/master/ext9.pdf.Ensuite, c’est tout naturellement que la cryptographie forte constituait un des centres d’intérêt des extropiens. Nécessaire pour préserver leur liberté, elle constituait une des briques de base pour parvenir à leurs fins. C’est pourquoi le mouvement extropien était en réalité étroitement lié au mouvement cypherpunk, lui aussi inspiré par le développement technique, de nombreuses personnes s’investissant dans les deux, comme Tim May, Hal Finney (qui a été cryogénisé par la Fondation Alcor en 2014) ou Nick Szabo.\nLes extropiens s’intéressaient enfin à la monnaie. Une monnaie solide était en effet nécessaire pour imaginer pouvoir conserver de la valeur à très long terme, par exemple dans le cas d’une cryogénisation. Le sujet était ainsi abordé dans le magazine Extropy. En 1993, Hal Finney a présenté le fonctionnement du système d’argent liquide électronique eCash29. En 1995, le numéro 15 de la revue a été ouvertement dédié à la monnaie électronique et à la concurrence des monnaies, comme l’attestait sa couverture illustrée par un billet de banque privée à l’effigie de Hayek30.\n29 Hal Finney, Protecting privacy with electronic cash, Extropy, vol. 10, 1993 : https://github.com/Extropians/Extropy/blob/master/Extropy-10.pdf.30 Extropy, vol. 15, 1995 : https://github.com/Extropians/Extropy/blob/master/ext15.pdf.\n\n\nLe billet fictif de 15 hayeks en couverture du magazine Extropy.\n\n\nLa monnaie numérique constituait donc l’un des enjeux mis en avant par les extropiens. Mais ces derniers ne le faisaient pas autant que les cypherpunks qui, des années plus tard, tenteraient de mettre en pratique leur connaissance de la cryptographie pour en créer une.",

    "text": "Le mouvement des cypherpunks\nLe mouvement cypherpunk est apparu en 1992 dans la Silicon Valley. Les cypherpunks étaient des gens qui prônaient l’utilisation proactive de la cryptographie en vue d’assurer la confidentialité et la liberté des individus sur Internet. Ils s’opposaient à la surveillance, à la censure et à l’exploitation des données personnelles, et préconisaient la programmation et la publication ouverte de logiciels, préférablement sous licence libre, dans le but de combattre ces menaces. Leur nom, calqué sur cyberpunk, était un mot-valise composé des mots anglais cypher, signifiant « chiffre » (dans le sens de code secret), et punk, désignant originellement un voyou. Les cypherpunks étaient donc formellement des rebelles amateurs de cryptographie.\nLes cypherpunks s’inspiraient partiellement du cyberpunk, un mouvement culturel construit autour de la littérature de science-fiction, qui prenait sa source à la fois dans la sous-culture des punks et dans la mouvance des hackers. Même si l’esthétique de ce dernier datait de la fin des années 70, le genre littéraire a largement été inauguré par l’écrivain William Gibson via la publication de ses premières nouvelles à partir de 1981 et surtout de son roman Neuromancien. Le mot, qui faisait référence à la cybernétique, c’est-à-dire la science des systèmes complexes et des réseaux, a quant à lui été inventé en 1983 par Bruce Bethke, et a été popularisé par Gardner Dozois en décembre 1984 dans un éditorial pour le Washington Post.\nLa caractéristique principale du genre cyberpunk était de décrire un futur dystopique où la technique de pointe était omniprésente (implants informatiques, réalité augmentée, réalité virtuelle, intelligence artificielle, robots) et où la société était sujette à la consommation à outrance (drogue, sexe, etc.), au crime généralisé et à l’avarice des corporations. Le cyberpunk décrivait ainsi un monde combinant haute technologie et bassesse humaine, pour reprendre l’expression de Bruce Sterling, dont le héros tentait de s’extraire tant bien que mal.\nDe ce genre cyberpunk est né tout un mouvement d’individus qui partageaient la même vision du monde, formant notamment une contreculture cyberdélique, née de la fusion de la cyberculture et du psychédélisme. Cette sous-culture en vogue dans la Silicon Valley était incarnée par la revue High Frontiers, fondée en 1984 par R. U. Sirius, qui est plus tard devenue Reality Hackers puis Mondo 2000.\nLes cypherpunks tiraient leur inspiration de ce mouvement. Toutefois, ils n’étaient pas pour autant des cyberpunks : s’ils avaient bien conscience des scénarios dystopiques qui pouvaient dériver de l’évolution technique (notamment en ce qui concerne la surveillance), ils ne partageaient pas la vision pessimiste relayée par le cyberpunk. De ce fait, le mouvement cypherpunk constituait en quelque sorte une réaction au cyberpunk, dans le sens où il postulait, à l’instar des extropiens, que l’évolution technique pouvait amener les êtres humains à s’émanciper plutôt qu’à tomber dans l’esclavage mutuel.\nLes cypherpunks basaient en particulier leurs réflexions sur une longue nouvelle publiée en 1980 par l’auteur de science-fiction Vernor Vinge, intitulée True Names. Cette nouvelle, qui abordait des thèmes propres au genre cyberpunk sans strictement en faire partie, contait l’histoire de Roger Pollack, un individu agissant au sein d’un groupe de pirates dans un monde virtuel appelé « The Other Plane », utilisant le pseudonyme de Mr. Slippery et faisant attention à ne surtout pas révéler son « Vrai Nom » (à savoir son nom civil) au risque de subir une « Vraie Mort » (par exécution étatique). Cet enjeu correspondait par conséquent à l’enjeu principal de la cryptographie : la préservation de l’anonymat dans le but de conserver sa liberté et, in fine, sa vie.\nLes cypherpunks avaient ainsi le regard tourné vers l’avenir. Mais leur préoccupation centrale concernait surtout l’avenir proche : c’était la confidentialité dans le cyberespace naissant31. C’est pourquoi leur mouvement pouvait rassembler des optimistes et des pessimistes, des extropiens et des cyberpunks, qui trouvaient du sens dans cette lutte contre la surveillance de masse.\n31 Le terme « cyberespace » (cyberspace) a été forgé par William Gibson dans sa nouvelle Gravé sur Chrome publiée en juillet 1982, pour désigner la représentation virtuelle des flux de données sur Internet. Le terme « matrice » (matrix) était utilisé en tant que synonyme.À l’origine, le mouvement cypherpunk a été le fruit de la pensée et de l’action de Timothy C. May, dit Tim May. Ce dernier était un scientifique, ingénieur et informaticien né en 1951 en périphérie de Washington D.C. Passionné de science-fiction et de physique, il avait travaillé pour Intel de 1974 à 1986, où il avait contribué à résoudre le problème des particules alpha dans les circuits intégrés. Il avait accumulé une certaine fortune au cours de ces années, si bien qu’il avait décidé de prendre sa retraite (à l’âge de 35 ans) pour se consacrer à ses passions politiques.\nTim May a rencontré Phil Salin en 1987, avec qui il a pu discuter des implications de la cryptographie. Ses discussions avec Salin, ainsi qu’avec d’autres personnes comme Marc Stiegler, l’ont poussé à écrire le Manifeste crypto anarchiste en août 1988. Dans ce manifeste, il posait les bases de ce qui allait devenir la doctrine des cypherpunks et décrivait le potentiel d’émancipation individuelle apporté par la cryptographie et par l’anonymat. Le manifeste, pastiche ironique du Manifeste du parti communiste, décrivait comment l’avènement des méthodes cryptographiques modernes allait, d’après lui, déstabiliser l’État en permettant aux individus d’échanger librement de l’information et de la richesse. En particulier, il écrivait :\n« Tout comme la technique de l’imprimerie a altéré et réduit le pouvoir des corporations médiévales et la structure sociale de pouvoir, les méthodes cryptologiques altèrent fondamentalement la nature de l’interférence de l’État et des grandes entreprises dans les transactions économiques32. »\n32 Timothy C. May, The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto, 22/11/1992 20:11:24 UTC : https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1992/11/msg00204.html.Tim May n’était pas seul à penser de cette manière et communiquait avec d’autres personnes qui partageaient ses idées. C’était le cas de son ami Eric Hughes, un jeune mathématicien et programmeur ayant grandi dans une famille mormone en Virginie près de Washington et à Salt Lake City. Ce dernier avait travaillé brièvement pour DigiCash à Amsterdam avant de revenir sur la côte Ouest. En mai 1992, alors qu’il cherchait à emménager dans la Silicon Valley, lui et Tim May ont longuement discuté de cryptographie, à tel point qu’ils ont décidé de reproduire ce type d’échange avec un plus grand nombre de personnes en organisant des réunions physiques.\nLa première réunion du mouvement cypherpunk a ainsi eu lieu au cours de la journée du 19 septembre 1992, dans la maison d’Eric Hughes à Oakland. L’accès à cette réunion se faisait uniquement sur invitation afin de préserver la discrétion du groupe. Libertariens pour la plupart, extropiens pour certains, les invités étaient des connaissances de May et Hughes issues de la communauté des hackers et des entreprises informatiques de la région. Durant la réunion, Tim May y a lu le Manifeste crypto anarchiste. En guise d’animation, les personnes conviées ont également participé à un « jeu de la crypto anarchie », qui consistait à simuler un réseau de mélange par l’échange et l’ouverture d’enveloppes de papier33.\n33 Certains détails de la formation des cypherpunks sont issus de l’ouvrage Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government–Saving Privacy in the Digital Age (pp. 257–266) de Steven Levy publié en 2001.34 « Et si nous pouvions construire une société dans laquelle les informations ne seraient jamais collectées ? [...] C’est le genre de société que je veux construire. Je veux que soit garantie - par la physique et la mathématique, pas par des lois - la possibilité de bénéficier de choses telles qu’une véritable confidentialité des communications personnelles, [...] une véritable confidentialité des enregistrements personnels, [...] une véritable liberté de commerce, [...] une véritable confidentialité financière [et] un véritable contrôle de l’identification. » – John Gilmore, Privacy, Technology, and the Open Society, 28 mars 1991 : http://www.toad.com/gnu/cfp.talk.txt ; archive : https://web.archive.org/web/19991003163945/http://www.toad.com/gnu/cfp.talk.txt.Parmi les invités se trouvait John Gilmore, un informaticien américain connu pour avoir été l’un des premiers employés de Sun Microsystems. Il avait aussi cocréé la hiérarchie ouverte alt.* sur Usenet et était un contributeur majeur du projet GNU. Alors en retraite anticipée depuis 1986, tout comme May, il s’était engagé dans l’activisme dans le but de protéger les libertés civiles sur Internet. En 1989, il avait cofondé Cygnus Support, une entreprise spécialisée dans le support professionnel de composants fondés sur GNU. Il avait également participé à la création de l’Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), une ONG internationale de protection des libertés sur Internet, aux côtés de Mitch Kapor et de John Perry Barlow en 1990. Lui aussi voyait la cryptographie comme un moyen de libération individuelle34.\nUne autre personne présente durant cette réunion fondatrice était l’activiste Judith Milhon, une femme née en 1939 qui avait participé au mouvement des droits civiques pour l’abolition des discriminations raciales dans les années 60 et avait été emprisonnée pour désobéissance civile. Programmeuse, hackeuse, elle était alors la coéditrice de la revue cyberpunk Mondo 2000, à laquelle elle participait sous le nom de plume de St. Jude. Elle était également la compagne d’Eric Hughes, malgré leur grande différence d’âge.\nC’est elle qui a donné leur nom aux cypherpunks lors de cette réunion, sur le ton de la plaisanterie. « Je pense que vous êtes des cryptoanarchistes – ce que j’appellerais des cypherpunks ! », a-t-elle écrit par la suite35. Le terme capturait bien l’esprit de la cryptoanarchie, tout en donnant au mouvement un côté moins formel et dogmatique. En effet, les gens préoccupés par ces enjeux n’étaient pas tous anarchistes : ils pouvaient s’opposer fermement à l’autoritarisme et à la surveillance, sans pour autant vouloir remettre en cause les fondements même de l’État36. C’est ce côté informel qui a fait que le terme a été adopté immédiatement.\n35 Judith Milhon, secretions, 25/09/1992 10:01:26 UTC : https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1992/09/msg00013.html.36 « De plus, cela donne à tort l’impression que “cypherpunk” est synonyme d’“anarchiste”. Il se trouve que je suis anarchiste, mais ce n’est pas ce en quoi croient la plupart des personnes associées au terme “cypherpunk”, et il n’est pas juste de les dépeindre ainsi – bon sang, de nombreuses personnes sur cette liste de diffusion sont ouvertement hostiles à l’anarchisme. Je ne veux pas que les gens pensent qu’il faut détester l’idée même d’État pour aimer la cryptographie. » – Perry E. Metzger, Re: PC Expo summary!!, 01/07/1994 12:13:09 UTC : https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1994/07/msg00014.html.Après la réunion, Eric Hughes, avec l’aide de Hugh Daniel, a créé une liste de diffusion de courrier électronique nommée « Cypherpunks ». Le courriel de bienvenue a été envoyé dans la soirée du 21 septembre (PDT). La liste était relayée par le serveur associé au nom de domaine toad.com appartenant à John Gilmore. Ce dernier a aussi offert la disponibilité des locaux de Cygnus pour les réunions ultérieures.\nLa liste a accueilli de nombreuses discussions relatives à la cryptographie et à son utilisation concrète, dont notamment l’argent liquide électronique. Beaucoup de gens sont intervenus dès les premiers mois, comme par exemple l’ancien pirate téléphonique John Draper. En un an à peine, la liste recensait ainsi plus de 500 participants.\nL’un de ces participants était Harold T. Finney ii, dit Hal Finney, informaticien et cryptographe américain, diplômé de Caltech et programmeur de jeux vidéos pour les consoles Intellivision et Atari VCS. Extropien et enthousiasmé par la popularisation d’Internet, il était obsédé par la cryptographie, à tel point qu’il était rentré en contact avec Phil Zimmermann pour travailler avec lui sur la version 2.0 de PGP, sortie le 2 septembre 1992. Hal Finney était aussi fasciné par les idées de David Chaum. En novembre 1992, il écrivait à la liste de diffusion :\n« Nous voici confrontés aux problèmes de la perte de confidentialité, de l’informatique envahissante, des bases de données massives, de l’augmentation de la centralisation – et Chaum propose une direction à suivre complètement différente, une direction qui met le pouvoir entre les mains des individus plutôt qu’entre celles des États et des grandes entreprises. L’ordinateur peut être utilisé comme un outil pour libérer et protéger les personnes, plutôt que pour les contrôler37. »\n37 Hal Finney, Why remailers..., 16/11/1992 01:30:02 UTC : https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1992/11/msg00108.html.La vision des cypherpunks était claire : mettre en pratique ce qui avait été jusque-là de vagues spéculations. Il était en effet stérile de théoriser des choses si cela ne se traduisait pas par des actions concrètes. Cet esprit pratique a été parfaitement résumé par Eric Hughes dans son Manifeste d’un Cypherpunk envoyé à la liste de diffusion en mars 1993, où il écrivait alors :\n« Nous devons défendre notre propre vie privée si nous voulons en avoir une. Nous devons nous rassembler et créer des systèmes qui rendent possibles les transactions anonymes. Depuis des siècles, les gens défendent leur vie privée par des chuchotements, par l’obscurité, par des enveloppes, des portes fermées, des poignées de main secrètes et des messagers. Les techniques du passé ne permettaient pas une forte confidentialité ; les techniques électroniques, elles, le permettent.\nNous, les Cypherpunks, nous consacrons à construire des systèmes anonymes. Nous défendons notre vie privée avec la cryptographie, avec les systèmes anonymes de transfert de courriels, avec les signatures numériques, et avec la monnaie électronique.\nLes Cypherpunks écrivent du code. Nous savons que quelqu’un doit concevoir des logiciels pour défendre la vie privée en général, et puisque nous ne pouvons pas avoir de vie privée si tout le monde n’en a pas, nous allons nous en charger. Nous publions notre code pour que nos collègues Cypherpunks puissent le mettre en pratique et expérimenter avec. Notre code est libre d’utilisation pour tous, dans le monde entier. Nous ne nous soucions guère que vous n’approuviez pas les logiciels que nous concevons. Nous savons que les logiciels ne peuvent pas être détruits et qu’un système largement dispersé ne peut pas être arrêté38. »\n38 Eric Hughes, RANTS: A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto, 17/03/1993 19:51:06 UTC : https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1993/03/msg00392.html.39 Steven Levy, « Crypto Rebels », Wired, 1 février 1993 : https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/. – Par la suite, le mouvement a également été présenté dans les revues Whole Earth Review et The Village Voice.Deux mois plus tard, en mai 93, le mouvement était définitivement lancé : les cypherpunks faisaient la une du magazine Wired, récemment fondé dans le but de parler de l’incidence culturelle, économique et politique des techniques émergentes. Tim May, Eric Hughes et John Gilmore apparaissaient masqués sur la couverture, et un long article détaillait leurs idées et leurs revendications39. C’était la préfiguration du rôle qu’ont joué par la suite les cypherpunks dans la sauvegarde de la liberté sur Internet.",

    "text": "L’action des cypherpunks pour la liberté\nLe mouvement cypherpunk est né juste après le triomphe des États-Unis dans la guerre froide les opposant à l’URSS et au début de l’adoption d’Internet par le grand public, amorcée notamment par la popularisation de Usenet et par l’apparition du World Wide Web. Il est apparu en quelque sorte « au bon moment » pour accompagner cette mutation majeure qui a marqué le monde entier.\nLe premier accomplissement des cypherpunks a été leur intervention dans la guerre contre la cryptographie orchestrée par l’État fédéral étasunien. Cette guerre a été inaugurée en février 1993 par la bataille contre PGP, lorsque Phil Zimmermann a été poursuivi en justice pour en avoir publié les deux premières versions en ligne, l’exportation de produits cryptographiques sans licence étant prohibée par la réglementation américaine (ITAR).\nCette décision a naturellement suscité une forte réaction de la part des cypherpunks qui, en réponse à la tentative d’application de cette réglementation absurde, se sont mis à partager le code de chiffrement dans une démarche de désobéissance civile. Le jeune britannique Adam Back l’a ainsi fait imprimer sur des t-shirts qu’il distribuait aux autres et certains ont été jusqu’à se le tatouer sur leur corps. En 1995, Phil Zimmermann a publié la version 2.6.2 de PGP dans un livre, dans le but de réduire au maximum la distinction entre le code et l’expression, cette dernière étant protégée par le premier amendement de la Constitution des États-Unis.\nLes charges contre Zimmermann ont finalement été abandonnées en 1996, notamment grâce au soutien de membres du MIT. Cela lui a permis de créer son entreprise pour travailler sur PGP et engager des employés, comme Hal Finney. En novembre de la même année, Bill Clinton signait l’Ordre exécutif 13026 qui assouplissait considérablement les restrictions sur l’exportation des produits cryptographiques.\nCependant, la guerre contre la cryptographie ne s’arrêtait pas là. En effet, elle ne concernait pas que l’interdiction d’utiliser la cryptographie forte, mais également l’obligation pour les constructeurs de matériel informatique d’intégrer des portes dérobées dans leurs produits. Le projet de loi sénatoriale 266, proposé par Joe Biden en 1991, devait ainsi faire en sorte que tous les appareils de communication puissent être surveillés par l’État fédéral :\n« Le Congrès estime que les fournisseurs de services de communications électroniques et les fabricants d’équipements de services de communications électroniques doivent veiller à ce que les systèmes de communications permettent au gouvernement d’obtenir le contenu en texte clair des communications vocales, informatiques et autres lorsque la loi l’autorise de manière appropriée40. »\n40 Comprehensive Counter-Terrorism Act of 1991, 24 janvier 1991 : https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/266/text.41 The White House, White House Annoucement of the Clipper Initiative, 16 avril 1993 : https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/clipper-announcement.html.Ce projet s’est matérialisé le 16 avril 1993 par l’annonce de la puce Clipper par la Maison-Blanche, un cryptoprocesseur servant à chiffrer les messages vocaux et les données, qui implémentait (au moyen de son algorithme Skipjack) un dispositif d’autorité de séquestre permettant aux agences étasuniennes de déchiffrer les communications au besoin. Cette puce était développée et produite par la NSA et était destinée à équiper les appareils électroniques vendus au grand public. La Maison-Blanche se justifiait en prétendant que la puce pourrait « à la fois fournir aux citoyens respectueux de la loi un accès au chiffrement dont ils ont besoin et empêcher les criminels de l’utiliser pour cacher leurs activités illégales41 ».\nCette annonce a provoqué une levée de boucliers chez les cypherpunks qui y voyaient un projet orwellien et s’y sont opposés en bloc. Cependant, la lutte n’a pas été longue : en juin 1994, le cypherpunk Matt Blaze a découvert une vulnérabilité au sein du dispositif d’autorité de séquestre, qui rendait le dispositif inefficace et permettait à la puce d’être utilisée pour chiffrer les données normalement. À partir de là, le projet a perdu progressivement en ampleur pour être définitivement abandonné en 1996. La liberté avait gagné, au moins temporairement42.\n42 Cette victoire contre la puce Clipper n’a pas empêché les agences étasuniennes d’espionner leur propre population de manière massive, comme l’ont montré les révélations d’Edward Snowden en 2013. – Voir Glenn Greenwald, NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily, 6 juin 2013 : https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order.Comme on l’a observé, l’optique des cypherpunks était d’être dans l’action, d’écrire du code et de partager des programmes qui puissent être utilisés. Ils se sont donc focalisés sur la construction de systèmes axés sur trois aspects majeurs : la protection de la vie privée, la diffusion de l’information et le commerce en ligne.\nLe premier domaine d’innovation a été celui des serveurs de courriel anonyme, qui permettaient de retransmettre les courriers électroniques de façon à masquer l’identité de leur expéditeur. Le premier serveur de ce type a été mis en place par Eric Hughes et Hal Finney pour la liste des cypherpunks dès octobre 1992, et il utilisait PGP pour le chiffrement. En 1994, Lance Cottrell a amélioré la chose en proposant le modèle Mixmaster, qui permettait d’envoyer des courriels par paquets de taille fixe et de les réordonner, pour empêcher le traçage des courriels par la surveillance de l’activité du serveur.\nOutre le courriel, l’objectif des cypherpunks était de rendre la navigation sur Internet plus anonyme, le fonctionnement du Web étant trop transparent. C’était l’idée des frères Austin et Hamnett Hill qui ont lancé le réseau Freedom en 1999 par l’intermédiaire de leur entreprise Zero-Knowledge Systems, qui employait notamment les cypherpunks Ian Goldberg et Adam Back. Mais cette expérience s’est arrêtée en 2001, faute d’utilisation suffisante.\nUn projet du même type dans lequel les cypherpunks se sont impliqués était le réseau Tor, lancé publiquement en 2003, qui se basait, comme on l’a déjà expliqué, sur le routage en ognon. En effet, si Tor était le résultat d’une recherche militaire provenant de la Navy, les individus ayant travaillé sur son implémentation n’en avaient pas moins des convictions allant dans le sens des cypherpunks. Roger Dingledine et Nick Mathewson, les deux informaticiens qui ont aidé Paul Syverson dans cette conception, en faisaient partie : le premier était derrière le projet Free Haven, qui avait pour but de développer un système décentralisé de stockage de données ; le second est crédité pour avoir créé le programme de serveur de courriel anonyme Mixminion. On peut également citer le jeune Jacob Appelbaum, qui s’est fortement impliqué dans le projet Tor entre 2004 et 2016.\nUn troisième secteur auquel les cypherpunks ont contribué a été la fluidification des flux informationnels, notamment face à la censure. En 1993, Tim May a repris le modèle de l’AMIX de Phil Salin pour introduire un concept de place de marché de l’information appelé BlackNet. Cette plateforme devait servir à échanger des secrets commerciaux, des recettes de fabrication, des techniques relatives aux nanotechnologies, des informations sur les décisions d’entreprises, au moyen de « CryptoCredits », la monnaie interne du système. Il s’agissait donc de libérer l’information des contraintes étatiques : « BlackNet n’est officiellement affilié à aucune idéologie, mais considère les États-nations, les lois d’exportation, les lois sur les brevets, les considérations de sécurité nationale, etc. comme des reliques de l’ère pré-cyberspatiale », écrivait Tim May43.\n43 Timothy C. May, no subject (file transmission), 17 août 1993, https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1993/08/msg00538.html.Le concept de BlackNet était une simple expérience de pensée et n’a jamais été mis en œuvre. Toutefois, il a préfiguré d’autres modèles qui ont ouvert la voie au partage d’informations sensibles sur Internet. C’était par exemple le cas de Cryptome, un site web lancé en 1996 par le cypherpunk John Young pour héberger des documents sensibles et censurés par les États.\nMais c’était surtout le cas de WikiLeaks, une plateforme facilitant la publication de documents classifiés fondée en 2006 par l’informaticien australien Julian Assange. Julian Assange était un cypherpunk assumé : il envoyait des courriels sur la liste depuis au moins 1995 et a par la suite coécrit un livre à ce sujet intitulé Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet. WikiLeaks a permis le développement de l’activité des lanceurs d’alertes (whistleblowers) révélant les agissements illégaux ou injustes de leurs employeurs, et en particulier des États, largement inaugurée par la publication des Pentagon Papers en 1971 par Daniel Ellsberg. Grâce à l’utilisation du chiffrement et de Tor, WikiLeaks permettait aux personnes à l’origine des fuites de conserver leur anonymat.\nEnfin, les cypherpunks se sont aussi investis dans le développement du pair-à-pair. En 2000, le développeur Jim McCoy, cypherpunk de la première heure, a ainsi lancé Mojo Nation, un projet de plateforme d’échange de fichiers en pair-à-pair intégrant une devise interne44. En 2001, un contributeur au projet, appelé Bram Cohen, s’en est séparé et a lancé son propre protocole, BitTorrent, qui est rapidement devenu une référence pour le partage de fichiers. Mojo Nation, alors rebaptisé Mnet, a été repris par Zooko Wilcox. Ce dernier a lancé son propre système, Tahoe-LAFS, en 2006.\n44 Damien Cave, The Mojo solution, 9 octobre 2000 : https://www.salon.com/2000/10/09/mojo_nation/.Mais ce qu’il manquait à tous ces systèmes, c’était une monnaie numérique robuste qui soit adaptée au cyberespace, chose à laquelle les cypherpunks aspiraient depuis le début. Leurs modèles possédaient parfois des unités de compte internes, mais elles étaient très instables. Malheureusement, une telle monnaie ne serait conçue que des années plus tard, en 2008, sous la forme de Bitcoin.\nSatoshi Nakamoto était-il un cypherpunk ? À notre connaissance, il n’a pas participé au mouvement originel des années 90, ni ne s’est jamais réclamé explicitement de celui-ci. Toutefois, il a très clairement été influencé par l’héritage des cypherpunks comme le suggèrent plusieurs éléments. D’abord, il semblait bien connaître ce qui s’était passé et de ce qui avait été fait précédemment dans le domaine de la monnaie numérique, malgré quelques lacunes (voir le chapitre 6). Puis, il a publié le livre blanc sur la liste de diffusion dédiée à la cryptographie gérée par Perry Metzger, qui était la digne héritière de la liste des cypherpunks, dont l’usage avait malheureusement périclité vers 1997. Ensuite, il a utilisé un pseudonyme et, par de bonnes pratiques comme l’utilisation de PGP, Tor et Namecheap, il est parvenu à préserver son anonymat malgré une activité en ligne s’étalant sur presque trois années. Enfin, il a « écrit du code » en programmant un outil émancipateur, conformément à l’appel à la pratique d’Eric Hughes. Il est donc tout à fait raisonnable d’associer Satoshi aux cypherpunks, tout en l’en dissociant partiellement, ne serait-ce parce qu’il est toujours resté très mesuré dans ses quelques jugements politiques.",

Les extropiens préconisaient la recherche et l’expérimentation pour améliorer drastiquement les conditions de vie matérielles de l’être humain. Les cypherpunks prônaient le fait d’écrire du code afin de préserver la confidentialité des individus dans le cyberespace. Il est donc naturel que la communauté de Bitcoin s’inscrive dans la même démarche en encourageant la pratique monétaire en vue de résister au contrôle de plus en plus grand de l’État et des banques sur le transfert d’argent.\nCependant, pour arriver à ce résultat, il a fallu concevoir un système qui permette de répartir les risques entre les participants sans nécessiter l’intervention d’un tiers de confiance.

    "text": "Monetary Exchange on the Internet\nThe Internet has generalized the sharing of information and, in doing so, has created a new space for human interactions: cyberspace. The emergence of this space naturally led to a demand for monetary exchange, which manifested through the development of e-commerce in the 1990s. As Robert Hettinga aptly summarized in 1998:\n“Since the invention of the telegraph, settling financial transactions has faced a problem: how to conduct business at a distance when the simplest way to execute, clear, and settle a transaction is through the exchange of bearer certificates1.”\nThe initial solution was to use bank credit. The use of bank credit as a medium of exchange had gradually become widespread in the West with the banking of society. Over time, a technical solution prevailed: the payment card, also called a debit or credit card depending on its operation. This solution wasn’t particularly innovative2, but it became considerably popular from the 1960s onward, through bank adoption and the formation of companies specializing in electronic funds transfer like NBI/Visa and Interbank/MasterCard3.\nHowever, payment by bank card wasn’t necessarily suited to cyberspace, as it was difficult to implement, costly, and not very secure at the time. This is why various technical solutions for making payments on the Internet emerged in the mid-1990s, such as CyberCash, First Virtual, or Open Market. Micropayment systems also appeared, like CyberCoin (managed by CyberCash), NetBill, and MilliCent.\nThese systems eventually failed, but it was in this niche that the PayPal service developed from 1999. It was designed to be easily accessible (PayPal literally means “pay friend”): it allowed easy, fee-free payments between email addresses. Its business model was based on collecting interest from holding clients’ funds in banks, to cover operating costs and remunerate shareholders. It was, therefore, a third-layer service built on top of the banking system, itself based on the central monetary system4.\nDespite the good intentions of their creators, these systems were entirely at the mercy of regulators. Those that survived consequently engaged in surveillance and censorship at an unprecedented level.\nThe second solution for exchanging value on the Internet was to issue a new digital currency in a centralized manner, possibly backed by an existing currency. This approach involved acting without seeking permission, exploiting the legal gray areas that could exist in a relatively new field.\nMassively multiplayer online games, including the famous MMORPGs, contributed to instilling the idea of an independent digital currency in people’s minds. Examples include the Token, the native currency of Habitat, one of the first graphical MMORPGs developed in 1985 by Lucasfilm Games for the Commodore 64. Other examples are the precious metal coins in EverQuest in 1999, the Linden dollar of Second Life in 2003, or the gold in World of Warcraft in 2004. All these cases demonstrated that a real economy could emerge from a virtual currency.\nAn anecdotal example of this type of digital currency system was the Hawthorne Exchange, launched on March 24, 1993, on the extropian mailing list by an individual named Brian Holt Hawthorne. It was a reputation market for list members, where the unit of account used for exchange was the Thorne. The system wasn’t very accessible or robust, but extropians used it and gave value to the Thorne in anticipation of the future. Some exchanges for dollars and services took place between list members. However, the Hawthorne Exchange was merely an experiment; the Thorne wasn’t intended to be a real currency, and its creator decided to stop it in ’94.\nA much more serious system appeared in 1996: e-gold. As described in Chapter 4, it was a digital gold currency model whose unit of account was theoretically backed by gold. The system relied on the company Gold & Silver Reserve Inc. founded by Douglas Jackson, which stored the physical gold in its vaults. It enjoyed great success in the 2000s before being shut down in 2007 by the Secret Service.\nHowever, the problem with this type of currency was that it still depended on an entity that constituted a single point of failure. Thus, even if those managing it were well-intentioned, such a system wasn’t robust and couldn’t endure in the long term.\nThe third solution for cryptocurrency was the conception of electronic cash that was confidential, uncontrolled, and decentralized. The idea was to minimize the role of the trusted third party as much as possible so that the currency would closely resemble physical cash in terms of minimizing required trust. Ideally, the goal was to obtain a “digital gold” that was “unforgeable, inflation-free, and untraceable5.”\nThe cypherpunks considered this type of digital currency essential in their fight for freedom and privacy. They planned to use such a unit of account in their projects, as evidenced by the Cryptocredits of BlackNet or the mojo of Mojo Nation. Naturally, they sought to develop such a currency.\nHowever, designing electronic cash—a true cryptocurrency—was no easy task. The quest to achieve it took many years to bear fruit. And the first step in this quest was the emergence of eCash, which had the merit of presenting a coherent proposal that met the cypherpunks’ requirements.",

    "text": "eCash: Chaumian Electronic Cash\neCash is a concept of confidential digital currency designed by cryptographer David Chaum in the 1980s and implemented during the 1990s. Initially described by Chaum in 1982, it was highlighted in 1985 in his article titled “Security without Identification,” which promised to “render Big Brother obsolete6.” The model is based on the mechanism of blind signatures, which guarantees ownership of the currency and transaction anonymity.\n6 David L. Chaum, “Security without identification: transaction systems to make big brother obsolete”, in Communications of the ACM, vol. 28, no. 10, October 1985, pp. 1030–1044: https://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/pub/secsem/chaum1985bigbrother.pdf.The eCash model manages digital banknotes of various denominations that users can hold. The banknotes are issued and replaced by servers called banks or mints. When a banknote is transferred, the recipient sends it to their bank, which verifies it and gives them another in return. The banks in the system each maintain a ledger of spent banknotes to prevent double-spending. The system is overseen by a central authority that issues the necessary permissions.\nIssuing a digital banknote uses the blind signature mechanism, as mentioned. For the user, it essentially involves choosing a large number and having it signed by their bank, so that this number remains known only to them. The functioning of this mathematical process is analogous to signing a physical banknote using carbon paper that represents a specific amount of monetary units (denomination). Here’s how Alice creates a banknote:\n\nAlice creates a banknote using carbon paper (by randomly generating a very large number ( x ));\nAlice places the banknote in a sealed envelope (using a commutative function ( c ) known only to her);\nAlice sends the envelope containing her banknote to the bank and specifies the desired denomination;\nThe bank signs the envelope, indicating the amount the banknote represents (the bank has a private key for each denomination), effectively signing the carbon paper banknote inside;\nThe bank returns the envelope to Alice;\nAlice opens the envelope to retrieve her signed banknote (using the inverse function ( c’ ));\nAlice verifies that the bank’s signature is authentic (by checking it against the bank’s public key associated with the requested denomination).\n\nTransferring the signed banknote is done by giving it to someone else. Thus, when Alice pays Bob for a service, the steps are as follows: first, Alice transmits the banknote to Bob; then, Bob verifies that it has been signed by Alice’s bank; next, he promptly sends the received banknote to his bank; finally, Bob’s bank checks that the banknote hasn’t already been used and, if valid, signs a new banknote of the same denomination to give to Bob.\n\n\n\nCreation and replacement of a Chaumian banknote.\n\n\nDigital banknotes can be issued on their own, forming a base currency. But they can also be backed by another currency like the dollar. In this case, the user can return their banknotes to their bank at any time to retrieve the corresponding amount.\nThe main consequence of this procedure is that none of the banks in the system can link the payment to Alice’s identity. Alice’s bank knows that a banknote it signed has been spent, but it cannot know for certain that it belonged to Alice. Bob’s bank knows that Bob received the payment and that it comes from Alice’s bank, but nothing more. This is why eCash can be considered a privacy-respecting model.\nHowever, the system’s confidentiality relies on a strong assumption: the benevolence of the system’s banks. Indeed, if a bank wanted to obtain information related to a particular banknote (e.g., under state pressure), it could request it from its owner in exchange for authorizing the transfer. One can imagine an eCash system that fully complies with surveillance standards, as suggested by Chaum’s implementation for a CBDC conceptualized in 20217.\n7 David L. Chaum, Christian Grothoff, Thomas Moser, How to Issue a Central Bank Digital Currency, March 2021: https://www.snb.ch/n/mmr/reference/working_paper_2021_03/source/working_paper_2021_03.n.pdf.",

    "text": "Magic Money, CyberBucks, and the Banks\nThe concept of eCash was implemented during the 1990s. At the time, the Web had just emerged, e-commerce was non-existent, and this idea represented a tremendous opportunity. This implementation was first undertaken by the cypherpunks through the Magic Money protocol, then by David Chaum’s company, DigiCash, using test tokens called CyberBucks and deploying within the traditional banking system.\nThe Magic Money protocol was introduced on the cypherpunks mailing list on February 4, 1994, by an anonymous developer known as Pr0duct Cypher, who used PGP for identification. Magic Money allowed users to create their own currency by running an email server that acted as an eCash mint8. Magic Money used the RSA algorithm and blind signatures, two techniques patented at the time, making its deployment de facto illegal and confined to experimentation. Nonetheless, the announcement was well-received on the list, notably by Hal Finney.\n8 “Magic Money is a digital cash system designed to be used via email. The system is online and untraceable. ‘Online’ means each transaction involves an exchange with a server to prevent double-spending. ‘Untraceable’ means it’s impossible for anyone to trace transactions, match a withdrawal with a deposit, or match two coins in any way.” — Pr0duct Cypher, Magic Money Digicash System, February 4, 1994, 20:44:27 UTC: https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1994/02/msg00247.html.9 Timothy C. May, Why Digital Cash is Not Being Used, May 3, 1994, 19:48:18 UTC: https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1994/05/msg00155.html.The first system based on Magic Money was launched by Mike Duvos a few weeks later with the Tacky Tokens, whose coins were issued in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 units. Despite proposals, no real transactions occurred, prompting Tim May to wonder “why digital cash [was] not being used9.” Other fanciful implementations of Magic Money followed, such as GhostMarks, DigiFrancs, or NexusBucks, but none achieved greater success. Activity quickly dwindled over the weeks.\nThe concept of eCash was then put into practice by DigiCash B.V., a company founded by David Chaum in 1990 and based in Amsterdam, whose mission was to implement the cryptographer’s ideas. Several cypherpunks worked for the company, including Eric Hughes, Bryce Wilcox (the future Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn), and Nick Szabo. After a few years of development, a prototype was presented in May 1994 at the first International World Wide Web Conference at CERN in Geneva.\nDigiCash then conducted a trial starting on October 19 of that year, issuing CyberBucks. Although their name references the U.S. dollar (“a buck”), they weren’t backed by the dollar and thus had a floating price relative to it. An initial distribution of 100 CyberBucks per new user was carried out to help bootstrap the system. The cypherpunks adopted the currency, engaging in real exchanges: rewarding problem-solving, selling T-shirts, selling software, and, of course, exchanging for dollars10. Various merchants accepted CyberBucks as part of this experiment.\n10 Jim Crawley, “Electronic Cash,” The Computists’ Weekly, vol. 5, no. 25, July 11, 1995: https://www.nzdl.org/cgi-bin/library?e=d-00000-00---off-0tcc--00-0----0-10-0---0---0direct-10---4-------0-1l--11-ro-50---20-preferences---10-0-1-00-0--4----0-0-11-10-0utfZz-8-00&a=d&cl=CL2.5&d=HASH0199d48acda6ba6861de2d9e.2.11 “Mark Twain came onto the market with real digital cash, and people completely stopped trading the beta certificates. I don’t even remember the last settlement price, but it was a few cents on the dollar.” — Robert Hettinga, e$: Interbank Digital Cash Clearing, Better Living through Walletware, Microintermediation, Net.Currencies and ECM, June 3, 1996, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/19980204144728/http://www.shipwright.com/rants/rant_14.html.However, CyberBucks were merely a test currency, and they declined in October 1995 when the Mark Twain Bank, a small Missouri bank, launched its own version of the protocol in partnership with DigiCash. Unlike the previous trial, the unit exchanged was backed by the U.S. dollar. Although the CyberBucks experiment didn’t technically end there, their value collapsed due to this development11.\nSubsequently, DigiCash formed partnerships with various banks to integrate into the traditional financial sector. Between 1996 and 1998, six banks around the world followed Mark Twain Bank: Merita Bank in Finland, Deutsche Bank in Germany, Advance Bank in Australia, Bank Austria in Austria, Den norske Bank in Norway, and Credit Suisse in Switzerland. The company was then promised a bright future12.\n12 Antoine Champagne, “Digital cash (cryptocurrency) was born in 1995: memories”, Reflets.info, January 11, 2014: https://reflets.info/articles/l-argent-liquide-numerique-crypto-curency-est-ne-en-1995-souvenirs.13 “Hoe DigiCash alles verknalde”, Next! Magazine, January 1, 1999, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/19990427142412/https://www.nextmagazine.nl/ecash.htm. An English translation is available at https://cryptome.org/jya/digicrash.htm.However, this didn’t account for David Chaum’s character—stubborn, suspicious, and intent on retaining control of his company13. He refused partnerships with major players like ING and ABN AMRO (two of the three largest Dutch banks at the time), Visa, Netscape, and Microsoft. Eventually, under pressure from shareholders and employees, he stepped down as CEO to become Chief Technical Officer, handing over to Michael Nash, a former Visa employee, in 1997. DigiCash’s headquarters were moved to California, effectively making it a U.S. company.\nOn September 17, 1998, Mark Twain Bank (acquired by Mercantile Bancorporation in 1996) announced it was abandoning eCash, leading to DigiCash’s demise. On November 3, the company filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the U.S., resulting in its assets being gradually sold off over the years, including its patents in 2002. With DigiCash, the very concept of eCash disappeared from circulation.\nIn 1999, Chaum explained the reasons for his company’s failure, namely the lack of adoption due to user difficulty. This disappearance gradually allowed payment cards and PayPal to prevail.\nThus, the end of DigiCash left a void in the digital cash market. But the demand never vanished, suggesting it would re-emerge in one form or another. As Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize-winning economist and founder of the Chicago School, predicted in 1999 to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation:\n“I think that the Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that’s missing but that will soon be developed is a reliable e-cash—a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B without A knowing B or B knowing A14.”\n14 Milton Friedman, Milton Friedman Full Interview on Anti-Trust and Tech (video), 1999: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwxdyLnMXM, 14:32.",

But not all members of the movement shared this view. A small group gathered on a private mailing list called libtech-l, where they discussed how money might evolve.\nThe libtech-l list, created in 1994 by Nick Szabo15, was intended to host discussions on liberating technologies capable of protecting individual freedom against authority, in the spirit of the extropian and cypherpunk movements, whose members also participated. Notably, contributions came from cypherpunks Wei Dai and Hal Finney, as well as economists Larry White and George Selgin. These five formed the core of this private list, from which several digital currency ideas would emerge.\n15 libtech-l@netcom.com — Timothy C.

Szabo, known as Nick Szabo, was an American computer scientist of Hungarian descent. An extropian and later a cypherpunk, he notably distinguished himself through his involvement in the fight against the Clipper chip. In 1994, he formalized the notion of the smart contract, which he defined as “a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract16,” and he elaborated on it in subsequent years.\nNick Szabo had a curious and eclectic personality, interested in numerous fields such as computer science, economics, politics, and biology, and wrote prolifically on these topics17. He had a particular interest in law, holding a liberal and natural-law perspective, which later led him to return to study and obtain a degree in the discipline in 2006.\n17 Nick Szabo’s writings are available on his old personal page szabo.best.vwh.net and his blog Unenumerated, started in 2005. — Archive of personal page: https://web.archive.org/web/20160709091851/http://szabo.best.vwh.net/; Unenumerated: https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/.18 Nick Szabo, Trusted Third Parties are Security Holes, 2001, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20020423191203/http://szabo.best.vwh.net/ttps.html.He worked for six months as a consultant for DigiCash in Amsterdam around 1995, where he learned about the detrimental (and ultimately fatal) role of trusted third parties. This experience fueled his obsession with minimizing trust, a theme he emphasized in his work18.\nHal Finney, as mentioned in the previous chapter, was a computer scientist and cryptographer living in the Los Angeles area. An early extropian and cypherpunk, he worked for Phil Zimmermann on the development of PGP—unofficially since 1992, then officially from 1996. Hal Finney was also passionate about David Chaum’s ideas, including his famous eCash19.\n19 “When I discovered Chaum’s work, I was blown away. The first article I found, I believe, was his article in CACM, which gave an overview of many possibilities. I started trying to find other articles by Chaum. All the techniques necessary to make Vinge’s world work were there, techniques that Vinge apparently already knew well before me.” — Hal Finney, Why remailers…, November 16, 1992, 01:30:02 UTC: https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1992/11/msg00108.html.20 Wei Dai, b-money, November 26, 1998, 23:33:49 UTC, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/19990219124653/http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai/bmoney.txt.Wei Dai was a young Chinese-American cryptographer living in Seattle. Having fled communist China and emigrated to the U.S. with his parents at age 10, he made his way into the professional world and was quickly hired by Microsoft, where he contributed to several patents. He discovered the cypherpunk movement in 1994 and joined it. The young prodigy contributed to cryptography, notably with Crypto++, a library of cryptographic functions in C++, and Pipenet, an anonymous communication protocol. He became interested in digital currencies and autonomous contracts from 1995, conceptualizing a model of anonymous credit in 1997. In 1998, Wei Dai stated he was “fascinated by Tim May’s crypto-anarchy,” where “the State [was] not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and unnecessary,” and where “violence [was] impossible because its participants [could not] be linked to their true names or physical locations20.”\nLawrence H. White, known as Larry White, and George A. Selgin were economists trained at prestigious universities. Both were inspired by the ideas of the Austrian School of Economics without fully adhering to it. Influenced by Friedrich Hayek’s works, notably his 1976 book The Denationalization of Money, which advocated for absolute competition in monetary and banking sectors, they endeavored from the 1980s to promote free banking systems where private currencies could be freely issued by financial companies, leading to market equilibrium.\nThese individuals on the libtech-l list sought to improve money. Having witnessed DigiCash’s fall and eCash’s failure, they were aware of the issues related to trusted third parties. Thus, Wei Dai, Nick Szabo, and Hal Finney each developed their own digital currency concepts: Wei Dai proposed b-money, Nick Szabo devised a model named bit gold, and Hal Finney built the RPOW system.\nTheir projects were based on the notion of proof of work, a concept implemented in 1997 by Adam Back with his Hashcash algorithm, initially intended to combat spam emails21. The British cypherpunk had considered making it the basis of a digital currency but recognized that such proofs of work couldn’t be transferred in a fully distributed manner (due to the double-spending problem), necessitating mint systems like eCash22.\n21 For a technical explanation of proof of work, refer to the dedicated section in Chapter 8.22 Adam Back, Re: Bypassing the Digicash Patents, April 30, 1997, 09:09:37 UTC: https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1997/04/msg00822.html.The idea of using proof of work as a currency basis was widespread. For instance, in 1996, Ronald Rivest and Adi Shamir described MicroMint, a centralized micropayment system whose coins were meant to be unforgeable thanks to proof of work production. But what was lacking was a well-structured system to bring it to life robustly and sustainably.",

    "section": "The b-money Concept",
    "text": "The b-money Concept\nThe first digital currency concept to emerge from the libtech-l list was b-money, proposed by Wei Dai. It was a decentralized protocol concept managing a unit of account of the same name, b-money, whose value was supposed to follow a basket of goods.\nWei Dai worked on his idea starting in 1995. As he later explained, his motivation was to “make possible the establishment of an online economy that is purely voluntary, an economy that cannot be taxed or regulated through the threat of violence23.”\n23 Morgen E. Peck, “Bitcoin: The Cryptoanarchists’ Answer to Cash”, IEEE Spectrum, May 30, 2012: https://spectrum.ieee.org/bitcoin-the-cryptoanarchists-answer-to-cash.24 Wei Dai, PipeNet 1.1 and b-money, November 26, 1998, 23:33:49 UTC: https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1998/11/msg00941.html.Wei Dai published the descriptive text of b-money on November 26, 1998, on his personal page. He shared the link with the cypherpunks mailing list in an email where he described b-money as “a new protocol for enabling untraceable pseudonymous entities to cooperate with each other more efficiently […] a proposal for an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system24.”\nThe text was brief (just over 1,000 words) but conceptually rich. Wei Dai described two versions of the protocol: one was unrealizable but simple; the other was more complex but based on more realistic assumptions.\nIn the first version, each participant was part of an untraceable peer-to-peer network. Each was identified by a “digital pseudonym” (i.e., a public key), and each transactional message was signed by the sender and encrypted for the recipient. Everyone maintained a separate database recording how many units of b-money each pseudonym possessed.\nMonetary creation was open to all participants and was done through proof of work by broadcasting the solution to a known, previously unsolved computational problem. The number of units created depended on the cost of this effort expressed relative to a standard basket of goods, potentially including precious metals: when its price relative to the basket increased, economic actors deployed more computing power to supply the market; conversely, when its price fell, they were incentivized to use less computing power, slowing b-money production. It was essentially a decentralized “stablecoin” before its time25.\n25 This mechanism to ensure b-money’s stability is reminiscent of the stablecoin managed by MakerDAO on Ethereum, aptly named dai! Later, Wei Dai criticized Bitcoin’s fixed monetary policy, arguing it would lead to “high price volatility imposing significant costs on its users.” — Wei Dai, Re: Bitcoins are not digital greenbacks, April 20, 2013, 07:56 UTC: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P9jggxRZTMJcjnaPw/bitcoins-are-not-digital-greenbacks?commentId=3XvTroRzb23NpHQDc.The system also offered the ability to create and execute contracts directly on the network through a rudimentary escrow process. In a contract, the involved parties were required to stake a bond and designate an arbitrator to intervene in case of disputes. Failing an amicable resolution, the network would decide based on the broadcasted evidence, theoretically favoring the arbitrator’s position.\nIn the second version, the property ledger was no longer maintained by everyone but by a subset of participants called servers. Participants in a transaction had to verify that their transaction was processed by sending requests to a random sample of servers. Since some trust in these servers was necessary, an economic proof-of-stake mechanism was established to ensure their honesty. Each server had to deposit an amount of b-money in a special account to be penalized in case of misconduct and was required to regularly publish its monetary creation and ledger.\nWei Dai’s b-money concept was quite ingenious for its time. However, it wasn’t functional and had major flaws. First, the first protocol version was impossible to implement on a large scale, notably because it couldn’t resist excessive multiplication of identities (Sybil attack), as anyone could easily add new computers to the network. Second, the second version seemed more realistic but effectively centralized the system into a small number of servers, making it more vulnerable to attacks and corruption. Finally, stability relative to a basket of goods would have required what’s now called a decentralized oracle system, a complex problem to solve26.\n26 Satoshi himself considered the oracle problem. In February 2009, he wrote: “Indeed, there is nobody to act as central bank or Federal Reserve to adjust the money supply as the number of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine value because I don’t know how software could know the real-world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency, February 18, 2009: https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A9562.b-money attracted the attention of cypherpunks, particularly Adam Back. Nevertheless, Wei Dai never implemented his model, not only because it was dysfunctional but also due to his disillusionment with crypto-anarchy. As he stated in 2014:\n“I didn’t take any steps to code b-money. Partly because b-money wasn’t yet a fully practical design. But the main reason I didn’t continue working on this idea was that I became disillusioned with crypto-anarchy around that time, and didn’t think such a system, once implemented, could really get enough traction27.”\n27 Wei Dai, Re: AALWA: Ask any LessWronger anything, March 15, 2014, 20:34 UTC: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YdfpDyRpNyypivgdu/aalwa-ask-any-lesswronger-anything?commentId=XKwphuwm366RegQ3d.",

    "section": "The bit gold Model",
    "text": "The bit gold Model\nThe second model to emerge from the libtech-l list was the bit gold system. It was intended to manage the creation and exchange of a virtual resource called bit gold. Unlike e-gold, which was backed by physical gold, or b-money theoretically indexed to a basket of goods, bit gold wasn’t to be backed by any other asset but to possess intrinsic, unfalsifiable scarcity, thus constituting a purely digital gold.\nIn 1998, Nick Szabo developed his idea of bit gold, initially describing it on libtech-l before hosting a draft white paper in 1999 on his personal website28. He publicly introduced bit gold in December 2005 in a blog post on Unenumerated29. The logic behind bit gold was to minimize trust to replicate, as much as possible, the costly production of precious metals in cyberspace.\n28 Nick Szabo, Bit Gold: Towards Trust-Independent Digital Money, 2005, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20140406003811/http://szabo.best.vwh.net/bitgold.html.29 Nick Szabo, Bit gold, December 29, 2005: https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html.30 In bit gold, computing the proof of work didn’t involve the partial inversion of a hash function (as in Hashcash) but a “secure benchmark function” that measured the problem’s difficulty on a specific machine. This aimed to approximate the energy level used. — See Nick Szabo, Intrapolynomial Cryptography, 1999, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20011217091748/http://szabo.best.vwh.net/intrapoly.html.The protocol’s central element was that monetary creation occurred through proof of work: pieces of bit gold were created using computing power30. Each solution was calculated from the previous one, forming a chain of proofs of work. Szabo referred to the actors responsible for this production as “miners.”\nThe date and time of these proofs of work were certified using multiple timestamp servers. This diversity, though not entirely satisfactory, aimed to limit the risk associated with any particular service.\nOwnership and exchanges were secured through a public registry of property titles. Users were identified by their public keys and signed transactions with their private keys. The registry was verified and maintained by a network of servers called the “property club,” which agreed upon the state using a consensus algorithm: Malkhi and Reiter’s Byzantine Quorum System. This allowed anyone to reference the registry to determine the owner of a piece of bit gold.\nInterestingly, the three core components of bit gold—the proofs of work, their timestamps, and the property registry—were separate. They were managed by different actors: miners, timestamp servers, and property club members. Later, in Bitcoin, these three elements would be combined into a single concept: the blockchain.\nDespite aiming to minimize trust, Szabo’s system had conceptual problems. First, the way the pieces of bit gold were produced made them non-fungible—they couldn’t be mixed together and had to be individually valued on a market to serve as a basis for a uniform unit of account. Second, bit gold relied on centralized timestamp servers, representing significant single points of failure. Finally, the system depended on a “classical” consensus algorithm that required property club members to be pre-selected, known to all, and that 66% of them behaved correctly.\nAt the time, bit gold was envisioned as a settlement system managing a rare reserve currency, upon which a free banking economy might be built, possibly using the Chaumian model. Nick Szabo pondered how to implement his idea for some time, even seeking help in April 2008 in a blog comment31. Szabo never implemented his concept, unlike Hal Finney, who attempted to do so with his RPOW system.\n31 “[Bit gold] would greatly benefit from a demo, an experimental market (with, e.g., a trusted third party substituting for the complex security needed in the real system). Anyone want to help me code one up?” — Nick Szabo, Re: Bit gold markets, April 10, 2008, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20171227190431/http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2008/04/bit-gold-markets.html?showComment=1207799580000#c3741843833998921269.",

    "section": "The RPOW System",
    "text": "The RPOW System\nHal Finney took Nick Szabo’s concept and simplified it to implement it in a novel system: Reusable Proofs of Work (RPOW), which he described on August 15, 2004. This system was based on a transparent server that allowed the proofs of work produced by Hashcash to be transferable. Thus, the security model didn’t stem from a distributed network as in b-money and bit gold32.\n32 See Hal Finney, RPOW Theory, August 15, 2004, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20040815154951/http://rpow.net/theory.html.In this system, RPOW tokens were managed by a server that signed them using RSA encryption. They were created by producing a proof of work via Hashcash or from a previous RPOW token. Each RPOW token comprised a value (defined as a power of 2) and data related to the server’s signature. Users could verify the token’s integrity themselves.\nThe RPOW system relied on a central server responsible for destroying and recreating proofs of work involved in each operation, notably verifying they weren’t double-spent. To ensure divisibility, the system allowed splitting an RPOW into multiple tokens of lesser value and combining multiple RPOWs into one.\nWhen making a payment, the sender gave their RPOW tokens to the recipient, who promptly communicated with the server to receive one or more new tokens totaling the input value. This operation of RPOWs was similar to digital banknotes in eCash: RPOW tokens depended on their contained information and could be transferred confidentially, but each transaction required interacting with the server to guarantee against double-spending.\nThe security model relied on the nature of the server: a “transparent server33” using the IBM 4758 Secure Cryptographic Coprocessor, a high-security cryptoprocessor resistant to tampering, allowing users to verify the programs running on the machine through an authentication process designed by IBM. This enabled external users to ensure at any time that the RPOW server was running the correct program, whose code was publicly available.\n33 Hal Finney, RPOW Security, August 15, 2004, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20040815154806/http://rpow.net/security.html.With his RPOW system, Hal Finney aimed to reduce required trust to a minimum. The system was confidential in that users never had to identify themselves to the server and could communicate securely. The server’s transparency allowed users to assure themselves the system wasn’t corrupted. In particular, it was reasonable to assume that the amount of RPOW tokens depended on actual proof-of-work production, allowing RPOW tokens to be equated with gold. In essence, it was a partial implementation of Nick Szabo’s bit gold.\nThe system was launched on the same day as its description, August 15, 2004. Hal Finney announced it on the cypherpunks mailing list, and the announcement was relayed on the Metzdowd.com list by Robert Hettinga. The system was updated several times to improve its functionality and remained operational for months.\nHal Finney presented his system at CodeCon 2005 in San Francisco. He discussed potential uses for RPOW, including value transfer, spam regulation (following Hashcash’s lineage), commerce in video games, online gambling like poker, and preventing freeloading on file-sharing protocols like BitTorrent34. Ever optimistic, Hal Finney envisioned a promising future for RPOW and planned to increase the number of servers worldwide once initial deployment was complete.\n34 Hal Finney, Reusable Proofs of Work, February 1, 2005, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20050204193327/http://rpow.net/slides/slide001.html.However, RPOW had intrinsic flaws that might explain why it didn’t achieve the expected success. The major drawback was its security model, which showed weakness: the server(s) had to be known and could be easily shut down, representing single points of failure. Additionally, its monetary policy, while theoretically viable, wasn’t particularly attractive due to the exponential growth in computing performance.\nConsequently, actual use of RPOW was minimal. The system was far from perfect and couldn’t, evidently, become a robust monetary system. Nonetheless, it served as an experimental proof of concept, four years before Bitcoin.",

His invention was thus a product of monetary localism.\nRyan Fugger published the Ripple white paper in 200435.

Each relationship comprised two parameters: existing debt, indicating how much one party owed the other, and potential debt, reflecting both parties’ willingness to lend and borrow. Ripple thus created a system where all participants acted as bankers. Regarding the base currency, the protocol could handle multiple units of account (dollar, euro, even hours of work), but these had to be converted when transferred to another currency.\nIn Ripple, payments were made by routing a series of loans. Assuming trust relationships between Alice and Bob, Bob and Carol, and Carol and David, Alice could pay David $10 by lending $10 to Bob, asking Bob to do the same with Carol, and Carol with David. David’s account would then be credited $10 originating from Alice’s monetary creation. This propagation of credit within a trust network explains the project’s name—“ripple” meaning “wave” or “undulation.”\nDebt settlement occurred by discovering credit cycles within the network. If Bob owed $5 to Alice, Carol owed $5 to Bob, and Alice owed $5 to Carol, their mutual debts could be canceled, allowing them greater borrowing capacity for future payments. A debt could also be settled directly between two parties in the specified unit of account.\nIn 2006, to advance his project, Ryan Fugger launched a proof of concept called Ripplepay. This was based on a central server (ripplepay.com) allowing users to connect with a simple email address. Fugger also created a Google Group in January 2007.\nDespite community enthusiasm and several thousand users, Ripple had inherent flaws due to its distributed operation. In particular, it suffered from the “decentralized commit problem36”: during a payment, participants couldn’t securely commit to ensuring the chain of loans37.\n36 fiatjaf, Ripple and the problem of the decentralized commit, October 17, 2020, 13:56 UTC: https://fiatjaf.com/3cb7c325.html.37 This problem has been addressed in some ways by the Lightning Network, which has a similar structure to Ripple, except that the unit exchanged isn’t credit per se. — See fiatjaf, The Lightning Network solves the problem of the decentralized commit, October 19, 2020, 19:09 UTC: https://fiatjaf.com/e3624832.html.Seeing his implementation wasn’t advancing, Ryan Fugger handed over his project to OpenCoin Inc.’s leaders, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb, in November 2012, after they approached him months earlier. They wanted to combine his idea with a new consensus algorithm developed by Jed, David Schwartz, and Arthur Britto. The result differed significantly from the original concept, introducing a native unit of account, XRP, and being more centralized and controlled than expected from a universal credit protocol. OpenCoin was renamed Ripple Labs in 2013. Ryan Fugger eventually changed his proof of concept’s name to Rumplepay in 2020 to avoid confusion.",

    "section": "Towards Bitcoin",
    "text": "Towards Bitcoin\nAll these digital currency concepts led directly or indirectly to Bitcoin, either because Satoshi Nakamoto was aware of these projects or shared the same references as their creators. Bitcoin was indeed the culmination of attempts to build a form of digital currency native to cyberspace.\nFirst, Satoshi Nakamoto was fully familiar with David Chaum’s eCash and had evidently read cypherpunk discussions on the topic. In the Bitcoin white paper, he clearly referenced it when addressing the double-spending problem, using the term “mint,” a common term among cypherpunks to denote Chaumian banks:\n“A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending38.”\n38 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.Furthermore, Satoshi Nakamoto explicitly acknowledged eCash’s weakness in his public and private communications. For example, in a February 2009 email to the p2p-research mailing list, he responded to Martien van Steenbergen’s comparison between Bitcoin and eCash:\n“Of course, the major difference is the absence of a central server. That was the Achilles’ heel of Chaumian systems: when the central company closed down, the currency went with it39.”\n39 Satoshi Nakamoto, [p2p-research] Re: Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency, February 12, 2009, 19:01:24 UTC: https://diyhpl.us/~bryan/irc/bitcoin-satoshi/p2presearch-again/p2pfoundation.net/backups/p2p_research-archives/2009-February.txt.gz.Privately, he wrote to Dustin Trammell in 2009:\n“I think there were a lot more people interested [in electronic cash] in the ’90s, but after more than a decade of failed, trusted third-party-based systems (Digicash, etc.), they see it as a lost cause. I hope they can make the distinction that this is the first time I know of that we’re trying a non-trust-based system40.”\n40 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin v0.1 released, January 13, 2009, 07:55:20 UTC, archive: http://web.archive.org/web/20131204164149/http://www.dustintrammell.com/files/Satoshi_Nakamoto.zip. He made a similar remark on the P2P Foundation forum. See Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency, February 15, 2009: https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A9493.41 Gwern Branwen, Wei Dai/Satoshi Nakamoto 2009 Bitcoin emails, March 17, 2014: https://gwern.net/doc/bitcoin/2008-nakamoto.The initial version of the white paper from August 2008 was titled straightforwardly “Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party,” with the filename ecash.pdf41, further reflecting Chaum’s influence.\nSatoshi Nakamoto had clearly considered eCash before designing Bitcoin. However, this wasn’t the case for b-money, bit gold, and RPOW, which he likely didn’t know about in 2007. Nevertheless, these systems played an indirect role in Bitcoin’s history.\nAs recounted in Chapter 1, during his preparation to publish his concept in August 2008, Satoshi contacted Adam Back, who referred him to Wei Dai after noticing similarities between Bitcoin and b-money. It was then that Satoshi added the reference to b-money in the white paper.\nSatoshi learned about Nick Szabo’s bit gold model later, probably through Hal Finney’s first message on the mailing list on November 7, 2008. Finney immediately noted the similarity between Bitcoin and Szabo’s system:\n“I also believe there is potential value in a form of unforgeable token whose production rate is predictable and can’t be influenced by corrupt parties. Such a token would be more comparable to gold than to fiat currencies. Nick Szabo described several years ago a related concept he called ‘bit gold,’ and this could be an implementation of that idea42.”\n42 Hal Finney, Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper, November 7, 2008, 23:40:12 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014827.html.The reference to bit gold was eventually added to Bitcoin.org’s webpage in early 2009, alongside the link to b-money’s description.\nSatoshi Nakamoto later acknowledged the resemblance of these two concepts to his own model. On July 20, 2010, in a forum discussion about Wikipedia possibly deleting Bitcoin’s article, he wrote to demonstrate the project’s legitimacy:\n“Bitcoin is an implementation of Wei Dai’s b-money proposal on the Cypherpunks mailing list in 1998 and Nick Szabo’s bit gold proposal43.”\n43 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: They want to delete the Wikipedia article, July 20, 2010, 18:38:28 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=342.msg4508#msg4508.This statement, meant to place Bitcoin within the history of digital currency, left a lasting impression, leading to b-money and bit gold often being cited as cryptocurrency forerunners.\nHowever, Satoshi Nakamoto never indicated he knew about Hal Finney’s RPOW system44. After all, it was merely an eCash model based on proof of work, with a central server transparent to users. Nonetheless, Hal Finney played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s early days and mentioned his system in 2013 on Bitcointalk45, so RPOW is now also considered a precursor to Satoshi’s discovery.\n44 Satoshi Nakamoto actually mentioned RPOW to Martti Malmi in a private email made public in February 2024. See Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin, July 21, 2009, 03:14:43 UTC: https://mmalmi.github.io/satoshi/#email-24. (Note from January 2025.)45 “I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Moreover, I was fortunate enough to meet and correspond extensively with Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, who are generally credited with developing ideas that would eventually be realized with Bitcoin. I had attempted to create my own currency based on proof of work, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin fascinating.” — Hal Finney, Bitcoin and me, March 19, 2013, 20:40:02 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.msg1643833#msg1643833.The proximity of these three men’s ideas to Bitcoin is striking, prompting speculation that Satoshi Nakamoto might be one or more of them. These men, who admitted to discovering Bitcoin’s existence fairly quickly (Wei Dai when Satoshi contacted him in August 2008, Hal Finney upon the white paper’s release, Nick Szabo in 2009), had the profile to conceive the concept, despite some contradictory elements. However, all three denied being Satoshi.\nThe last digital currency project that influenced Bitcoin’s history was Ryan Fugger’s Ripple. Even though it didn’t closely resemble Bitcoin, it impacted its development. Satoshi Nakamoto knew about Ripple. In February 2009, on the P2P Foundation’s forum, he responded to Martien van Steenbergen’s reference to it:\n“As for trust-based systems, Ripple is unique in that it distributes trust rather than concentrating it in a central server46.”\n46 Satoshi Nakamoto, [p2p-research] Re: Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency, February 13, 2009, 02:31:20 UTC: https://diyhpl.us/~bryan/irc/bitcoin-satoshi/p2presearch-again/p2pfoundation.net/backups/p2p_research-archives/2009-February.txt.gz.47 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Questions about BitCoin, April 12, 2009, 20:44 UTC: https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html.Another link between Ripple and Bitcoin is developer Mike Hearn’s involvement. He became interested in Ripple from its early days and, in 2007, was among the first to contribute to the newly created Google Group. Upon discovering Bitcoin in April 2009, Hearn asked Satoshi Nakamoto about this alternative model, and Satoshi replied that Ripple was “interesting” as it was “the only other system that does something with trust besides concentrate it into a central server47.”\nBut Ripple differed significantly from Bitcoin, particularly because it was a distributed credit system rather than a decentralized base currency. This distinction distanced Ryan Fugger, who didn’t see “why a bitcoin would have any value since there was apparently nothing to back it,” though he eventually acknowledged that Satoshi Nakamoto’s model was “a great idea48.”\n48 Ryan Fugger, Re: Is the cryptocurrency Bitcoin a good idea?, May 17, 2011, 07:44:33 UTC: https://www.quora.com/Is-the-cryptocurrency-Bitcoin-a-good-idea/answer/Ryan-Fugger.Bitcoin thus added the final piece to the electronic cash puzzle. It provided a technique to build a truly solid and durable cryptocurrency capable of withstanding real-world challenges. On January 26, 2009, Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn expressed this sentiment in a blog post, later shared on Bitcoin.org. Here’s the full text:\n“For some time now, I’ve been thinking about how game services like World of Warcraft and Second Life (which claims not to be a game) have succeeded where we at DigiCash failed: developing functional, widely used, programmable digital cash. The problem is that any such new currency is centrally controlled by a single entity, limiting the scope of action for those who depend on it and the value they’re willing to risk on it. Some proposals aim to make currency exchange easier, but this approach doesn’t solve the problem. A plethora of competing centralized services isn’t the same as a decentralized service. Even if it were cheap and convenient to exchange between Linden Bucks and WoW gold, we’d just return to the equivalent of modern nation-state currencies: essentially centralized currencies (due to the network effect), heavily taxed/regarded/manipulated, and prone to disastrous collapses. What I want is a currency that everyone can use conveniently and cheaply, but that no one has the power to manipulate. I want no one to have the power to inflate or deflate the money supply; no one to have the power to monitor, tax, or prevent transactions. A true digital equivalent of gold, in times and places where gold was the universal currency. See Nick Szabo’s bit gold idea and Wei Dai’s b-money idea, and the recent attempt to implement such a system: Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin49.”\n49 Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, Decentralized Money, January 26, 2009, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20090303195936/http://testgrid.allmydata.org:3567/uri/URI:DIR2-RO:j74uhg25nwdpjpacl6rkat2yhm:kav7ijeft5h7r7rxdp5bgtlt3viv32yabqajkrdykozia5544jqa/wiki.html#%5B%5BDecentralized%20Money%5D%5D.",

    "text": "Data Representation\nIn computing, information is a set of data stored on a physical medium. It is commonly represented in the form of binary digits (called bits, a contraction of “binary digits”) to reflect the operation of the digital electronics used in computers. The two possible values (0 and 1) correspond to two distinct electrical states, such as the presence or absence of current.\nIn this context, information is essentially a number. Even if it appears as multimedia content, information must be encoded to be processed and interpreted by computers. Typically, text can be encoded in ASCII or UTF-8, images in JPEG or PNG, music in MP3 or FLAC, and videos in MPEG or H.264. In this way, everything reduces to numbers.\nIn our modern Western world, we are accustomed to representing numbers using a numeral system with 10 digits, based on base 10. This is a convention linked to the fact that we have long counted using our 10 fingers. But the decimal system is not the only one that exists, and computing uses several other bases.\nFirst, as mentioned, computers are based on a binary system composed of two digits (0 and 1). These two digits are used to write numbers: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, etc. In this system, the number 21 (base 10) is expressed as follows:\n\\[21 = 16 + 4 + 1 = \\mathbf{1} \\times 2^4 + \\mathbf{0} \\times 2^3 + \\mathbf{1} \\times 2^2 + \\mathbf{0} \\times 2^1 + \\mathbf{1} \\times 2^0 = \\mathtt{0b10101}\\]\nThe prefix 0b is usually placed before the number to indicate that it is expressed in binary.\nAnother numeral system commonly used in computing is the hexadecimal system, which is composed of 16 digits symbolized by the 10 Arabic numerals and the first six letters of the Latin alphabet:\nIn this base, “a” represents the number 10, “b” represents 11, and so on up to “f,” which represents 15.\nThe hexadecimal system allows for a condensed representation of data. In particular, it is very suitable for writing bytes, which are sets of 8 bits and can be symbolized by 2 hexadecimal characters. In this way, the number 2008 (base 10) is written:\n\\[2008 = 1792 + 208 + 8 = 7 \\times 16^2 + 13 \\times 16^1 + 8 \\times 16^0 = \\mathtt{0x7d8}\\]\nWe usually place the prefix 0x before the number to indicate that we are using the hexadecimal system.\nIn Bitcoin, two additional numeral bases are involved, notably to represent certain crucial information such as private keys and addresses. The first is base 58. In this system with 58 digits, numbers are written using all alphanumeric characters (Arabic numerals, lowercase Latin letters, uppercase Latin letters) except for the characters 0 (zero), O (uppercase o), l (lowercase L), and I (uppercase i), which can be confused with each other and cause errors. The digits of this base are, in order:\nThe second is base 32, less compact but more suitable for QR codes. The symbols used in this base are Arabic numerals and lowercase Latin letters, excluding 1, b, i, and o to avoid confusion, namely the following characters:\nThese encoding systems allow for the raw representation of information. However, information can also be encoded in a particular format that includes a checksum. A checksum is a short sequence of numerical data calculated from a larger set of data, allowing one to verify, with high probability, that the integrity of this set has been preserved during copying, storage, or transmission. It is generally placed after the information so that the whole can then be represented in the appropriate base.\nIn the case of Bitcoin, the checksum is essential for transmitting sensitive information such as private keys and addresses, so that a typing error is immediately detected. The three encodings that implement this type of checksum in BTC are the Base58Check, Bech32, and Bech32m formats. The first was implemented by Satoshi in the early days of the cryptocurrency and involves calculating a checksum through the truncated cryptographic hash of the information. It concerns private keys and so-called “legacy” addresses, such as the address 1FjBKPQ7MTiPSDkJ2ZwPgAXUKQ8yoGbVJX.\nThe other two emerged in 2017 and 2021 (respectively). They involve checksums using BCH codes (Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem), which not only detect the presence of typos but also locate them. These formats are used to encode (respectively) native SegWit addresses, such as bc1q5x9a0aqmgtrucm4l5n0y8e4kxfy9xm4udhygr2, and public keys used in Taproot, such as bc1pqlqqhzrg60v5h87r8lugusrddgz0j306shcupthy0tdqaqurwn8qr8qsej. The Bech32 format is also used to encode payment requests on the Lightning network.",

    "text": "Cryptography and Bitcoin\nCryptography is the mathematical discipline aimed at securing communication in the presence of malicious third parties. Its initial role was to conceal information through encryption but later expanded to authenticating the sender of a message (through asymmetric cryptography) and verifying data (using one-way functions). Today, cryptography ensures the confidentiality (encryption), authenticity (signature), and integrity (hashing) of transmitted information.\nBitcoin is a cryptographic product. Technically, it relies on methods developed in the last decades of the 20th century, such as Merkle trees or proof of work. Ideologically, it stems from the cypherpunk movement, which advocated the proactive use of cryptography to safeguard individuals’ privacy and freedom on the Internet. In both senses, it is described as a cryptocurrency.\nIn the context of Bitcoin, encryption can be useful for protecting private keys or sending messages to other users. In many wallets, it is common for private keys to be encrypted using a password (secret key) to prevent malicious individuals with access to the device from spending the funds. In Electrum, for example, private keys are encrypted using the symmetric algorithm AES-256-CBC.\nHowever, contrary to what one might imagine, no encryption is directly involved in the Bitcoin protocol: all data is public due to the system’s open and permissionless functioning. Bitcoin is not a cryptographic product because transactions are encrypted (they are not) but because it relies on the other two functions of cryptography: authentication through digital signatures and data verification with hashing. Digital signatures authenticate the person initiating a transaction to assure the network that they are the owner of the bitcoins being spent. Hashing is involved in key and address derivation, block construction, and mining operations.",

    "section": "Digital Signatures",
    "text": "Digital Signatures\nSince Bitcoin is designed for the exchange of value, it fundamentally relies on transactions. These are, in most cases, transfers of units between two owners, although they can take much more complex forms, as we will see in Chapter 12. The unit transferred is typically the satoshi, which is the smallest unit (indivisible) managed by the protocol and corresponds to one hundred millionth of a bitcoin: 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 bitcoin. It was named in honor of Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto1.\n1 The term “satoshi” was initially proposed by ribuck on the Bitcoin forum, first in November 2010 to designate 0.01 bitcoin, then in February 2011 to name the smallest unit. The name was then adopted by the community. — ribuck, Re: How did “satoshi” become the name of the base unit?, 09/01/2014 20:49:00 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=407442.msg4415850#msg4415850.In the protocol, the digital signature is used to authorize these fund movements. As described in Chapter 5, this process is based on a pair of keys: a private key, which is secret and signs the message, and a public key, known to all, which allows one to verify the produced signature. In the case of a simple transfer, the message to be signed is the transaction, and the signer of the message is the owner of the satoshis being sent.\nThe signature algorithm produces a different signature for each transaction. It’s not just about revealing a secret to make a spend, which would allow anyone on the network to attempt to spend the funds, but about producing data that can then be verified by the network as expected.\nThis functioning gives a fundamental role to the private key. Anyone who knows it can access the funds it protects and seize them. This is why it must remain absolutely secret: whoever knows it becomes the de facto owner of the bitcoins concerned.\nThe main algorithm used in Bitcoin is ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), a variant of DSA using elliptic curve cryptography. The algorithm involves complex algebraic notions, but we can attempt to briefly explain how it works.\nThe variant of ECDSA used in Bitcoin is based on the elliptic curve secp256k12, which is used to derive the public key from the private key, to sign transactions using the private key, and to verify signatures using the public key. The mathematical equation of this curve is ( y^2 = x^3 + 7 ), where the coordinates ( x ) and ( y ) evolve within the finite field of integers modulo ( p ), where ( p ) is a specific prime number3 less than ( 2^{256} ).\n2 The name secp256k1 might seem obscure, but each letter is significant. The acronym SEC stands for “Standards for Efficient Cryptography,” the work from which it originates (https://www.secg.org/SEC2-Ver-1.0.pdf). The P-256 indicates that the prime number \\(p\\) used is encoded on 256 bits. The “k” indicates it’s a Koblitz curve: parameters are chosen to make operations more efficient and were not selected randomly (“r”). The “1” denotes the index of the curve relative to other similar curves.3 The chosen prime number for secp256k1 is: \\(p = 2^{256} - 2^{32} - 2^9 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1\\).\n\n\nGraphical representation of the secp256k1 curve over real numbers (source: Loïc Morel, Bitcoin Démocratisé, 2022).\n\n\nAn addition is defined on this curve so that the sum of two points is also a point on the curve[^316]. Multiplication by a scalar is defined as adding the same point multiple times: ( m~P = P + + P(m) ). By fixing a point on the curve, called the base point and noted ( G )[^317], we can define an operation transforming an integer ( d ) into a point on the curve: ( Q = d~G ).\nThese operations can be represented geometrically on the curve. For example, the geometric equivalent of doubling point ( G ) (adding it to itself) involves drawing the tangent at the point, considering the intersection of this tangent with the curve, and taking its opposite, as shown in Figure 7.2. All these operations are non-reversible.\n\n\n\nGeometrical representation of doubling point G on secp256k1 (source: Loïc Morel, Bitcoin Démocratisé, 2022).\n\n\nBy choosing a private key ( k ), we can calculate the public key ( K ) which is ( K = k~G ). Since multiplication by a scalar is non-reversible, transitioning from the private key to the public key constitutes a one-way function. In other words, it is practically impossible to find the private key from the public key without trying every possibility one by one.\nLet’s see what this looks like in practice. The private key is a randomly chosen number. It must be between ( 1 ) and ( n - 1 ), where ( n ) is the order of point ( G ) (which is close to ( 2^{256} )):\n\\[n = \\mathtt{0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03bbfd25e8cd0364141}\\]\nFor example, the following hexadecimal number is perfectly valid to serve as a private key:\n\\[k = \\mathtt{0x999bb87eea489b2fc6219226e7b95d9083a3b627246ea852e85567ac4d72444f}\\]\nThe public key is a point on the curve defined by ( K = k~G ). If we compute this point from the above private key, we obtain:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nK = &~(\\mathtt{0xf6a6c7c39c88b767bfac4ac687c3ff32372e76c9fb633e2278e54472e300b3bd}, \\\\\n    &~\\mathtt{0x5822f24e0fdb4e568f97a7fff246c07ba486c1756f82971765cc9cf8e45ff5e6})\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nIn Bitcoin, this public key is represented in serialized form. It can be uncompressed, in which case it is prefixed by 0x04. In our case, its serialized expression is:\n04 f6a6c7c39c88b767bfac4ac687c3ff32372e76c9fb633e2278e54472e300b3bd\n5822f24e0fdb4e568f97a7fff246c07ba486c1756f82971765cc9cf8e45ff5e6\nThere is also a compressed representation of the public key. This is possible due to the symmetry of the curve with respect to the x-axis: indeed, the fact that point ( (x, y) ) belongs to the curve implies that point ( (x, -y) ) also does. To compress the information, it suffices to provide the abscissa ( x ) and a prefix that is 0x02 if ( y ) is even or 0x03 if ( y ) is odd4. We can then recover ( y ) using the curve’s equation. In our case, the compressed public key is:\n4 In the finite field \\(\\mathbb{F}_p\\), taking the opposite of a non-zero element \\(y\\) reverses its parity. Indeed, if \\(y \\in [\\![ 1, p - 1 ]\\!]\\), then \\(-y + p \\in [\\![ 1, p - 1 ]\\!]\\).02 f6a6c7c39c88b767bfac4ac687c3ff32372e76c9fb633e2278e54472e300b3bd\nThis format reduces the size of transactions (and thus fees), which is why it is used in most recent wallets and is required in the case of SegWit. The uncompressed format is thus tending to disappear, although it remains valid in classic transactions.\nIn Bitcoin, the public key was initially used to receive funds directly (“Pay to Public Key”), so it is still sometimes confused with the notion of an address. However, it is generally its hash obtained through hashing (“Pay to Public Key Hash”) that serves as the receiving address, as we will describe below.\nThe ECDSA signing algorithm applies to a message ( m ) that is previously hashed and produces a signature ( (r, s) ). It is then possible to match the signature with the public key ( K ) using a verification algorithm that does not require knowing the private key ( k )5.\n5 The ECDSA signing algorithm is as follows. Denoting \\(H(m)\\) as the cryptographic hash of the message to be signed, the signature is obtained by applying the following steps:6 This is the signature of transaction 08e5ce0783ab6d5534e234136df02e0e240f76108eb6af04b8b624646b66f5eb. In serialized form (DER), this signature is 3044022019b83a5e354ef62e98413e6ef3f37ad0c69f75cea7daa6a352cf66f4668a9a0b02204c13f9b6f2c8ea7af224b3f6a3d9cfdfe5085bbafa150fb1aa72a20ce7cac6b001.In Bitcoin, the message is the transaction. The verification algorithm thus shows that the person who produced the signature knows ( k ) such that ( K = k~G ), meaning they are the owner of the bitcoins. This allows nodes on the network to ensure the validity of signatures and, consequently, the transaction. An example of a signature corresponding to our public key and a transaction made on the main network is6:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n(r, s) = &~(\\mathtt{0x19b83a5e354ef62e98413e6ef3f37ad0c69f75cea7daa6a352cf66f4668a9a0b}, \\\\\n    &~\\mathtt{0x4c13f9b6f2c8ea7af224b3f6a3d9cfdfe5085bbafa150fb1aa72a20ce7cac6b0})\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nNote that the ECDSA algorithm presented here is not the only one that exists. In November 2021, BTC integrated another algorithm—the Schnorr digital signature scheme—which is based on the same elliptic curve but offers major benefits. Other Bitcoin variants like Monero use EdDSA, a signature algorithm based on a twisted Edwards curve.",

    "text": "Hashing\nBitcoin also makes use of hashing. Hashing is a cryptographic process that ensures the integrity of digital information. The name of this process comes from an analogy with cooking, where foods can be chopped into small pieces and grouped into a hash. It is implemented by a hash function that transforms a message of variable size into a hash of fixed size. This hash is also called a digest or simply a hash.\nHash functions are deterministic functions that are easily executable and, in theory, have three characteristics7:\n7 These are assumptions, and some functions satisfy these characteristics more than others. For example, collisions have been found in MD5 and SHA-1 functions that were thought to be secure.\nIrreversibility: They are one-way functions constructed so that it is difficult to retrieve the original message from a given hash (preimage resistance).\nUnpredictability: Any modification of the original message results in a drastically different hash, making it difficult to find a similar hash.\nCollision resistance: It is difficult to find two messages that result in the same hash.\n\nOne of the most well-known functions is SHA-256, whose name comes from “Secure Hash Algorithm” and the size of the hashes it produces (256 bits, or 32 bytes). For example, if we consider the message “Bitcoin,” spelling it in lowercase or adding a period completely changes its hash, as shown in Table 7.1. This feature notably allows for detecting errors in the message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage\nHash (SHA-256)\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin\nb4056df6691f8dc72e56302ddad345d65fead3ead9299609a826e2344eb63aa4\n\n\nbitcoin\n6b88c087247aa2f07ee1c5956b8e1a9f4c7f892a70e324f1bb3d161e05ca107b\n\n\nBitcoin.\na9adf3c04d168153b296083f05015f587d7df6e0b85305b6c7beb2a69e3f4e75\n\n\n\nHashes by SHA-256 of slightly different messages.\n\nHashing is involved in multiple areas within Bitcoin: in the signing algorithm (message hashing), in calculating addresses, in key derivation, for computing checksums, for calculating transaction and block identifiers, in constructing Merkle trees in blocks, and finally at the core of mining.\nThree hash functions are used: SHA-256, which produces 256-bit (32-byte) hashes; RIPEMD-160, whose name stands for “RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest” and results in 160-bit digests; and SHA-512, which hashes data into 512-bit hashes.\nThe most frequently used function is double SHA-256 (noted SHA-256d or HASH-256), which appears almost everywhere. It is supposed that this doubling implemented by Satoshi was intended to protect against length extension attacks. The composition of SHA-256 with RIPEMD-160 is used for calculating addresses. This is the only substantial use of RIPEMD-1608. Finally, SHA-512 is used in the key derivation algorithm implemented in wallets.\n8 “Bitcoin addresses are the only place where 160-bit hashing is used.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Stealing Coins, 07/25/2010 20:48:01 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=571.msg5754#msg5754.",

    "section": "Private Keys",
    "text": "Private Keys\nEssentially, a private key is digital information—that is, a number. More precisely, it is a very large number between ( 1 ) and ( n-1 ), where ( n ) is the order of point ( G ) and approaches ( 2^{256} ), approximately ( 1.1579 ^{77} ). The interval is exceedingly vast, making it statistically impossible to stumble upon the same private key by choosing at random. For comparison, the number of atoms in the observable universe is close to ( 10^{80} ).\nThe private key is randomly created, most often using pseudo-random number generator algorithms that aim to reproduce randomness as faithfully as possible in computing. This generation relies on the device’s computational entropy—that is, the amount of randomness it collects through hardware sources (variance of fan or hard drive noise) or external sources (mouse movement, keyboard signals, etc.). Tools used to generate private keys are usually considered cryptographically secure (CSPRNG).\nThe randomness of the process is fundamental, forming the basis of the model’s security. For example, someone who chooses the number 1 as a private key could never use the corresponding address, as the security linked to this key is nil. All bitcoins deposited to this address would be instantly debited by a specialized program9.\n9 One can observe the address 1EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm (corresponding to key 1) to be convinced that this is not a good choice.10 BitMEX Research, Call me Ishmael, October 13, 2020: https://blog.bitmex.com/call-me-ishmael/.The same goes for “brain wallets,” which rely on memorizing information and are often created insecurely. People typically start with a coherent phrase (like a quote from a book or song) to make it easy to remember, then hash it and use the resulting hash as a private key. This practice is highly risky due to the strong predictability of human language, and addresses created this way are likely to be emptied, as shown in a BitMEX Research investigation10.\nThis importance of randomness is also reflected in the ECDSA algorithm, which relies on generating an ephemeral key to produce the signature. If this value is not correctly generated, an attacker could deduce private keys from signatures. This is what happened in August 2013 when a vulnerability (CVE-2013-7372) was discovered within Java’s SecureRandom function, affecting the security of several Android software wallets11. Exploiting this flaw led to the loss of at least 55.82 bitcoins, about $5,200 at the time.\n11 Bitcoin.org, Android Security Vulnerability, August 11, 2013: https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-08-11-android.After being generated, private keys must then be encoded to facilitate their transmission for import into a wallet or export. In Bitcoin, they are represented using the Base58Check encoding. This is why we sometimes refer to the Wallet Import Format (WIF).\nEncoding a key follows a series of simple steps. First, the key is prefixed with the version byte 0x80, indicating that it is a private key. Then, a suffix 0x01 is added (or not) to indicate whether we want to derive a compressed (or uncompressed) public key. In the case of our example key, we obtain the following bytes:\n80 999bb87eea489b2fc6219226e7b95d9083a3b627246ea852e85567ac4d72444f 01\nNext, the checksum is calculated by taking the first 4 bytes of the double SHA-256 hash and added after the set:\n80 999bb87eea489b2fc6219226e7b95d9083a3b627246ea852e85567ac4d72444f 01\n1dd28791\nFinally, the whole is encoded in base 58. In the “compressed” case, the key always starts with a K or an L. Here, our private key is written:\nL2NJfKog9SEdoAkAkm8ZNYDcpWQop95orPepbhsTE2t5Bf1yFmYk\nIn the “uncompressed” case (less commonly used), the key always starts with a 5. Here, our private key becomes:\n5JywJHwyuD4YSsErniGJkrDNi87kggSZNADCEkhRyRScqfMMTEt",

    "section": "Addresses",
    "text": "Addresses\nIn Bitcoin, an address is essentially an account number used to receive funds. This data is publicly available on the blockchain, and anyone can verify its balance. However, a user can generate as many addresses as they wish to avoid revealing all their activity.\nGenerally, an address is the hash of a public key (PKH), the public key itself (PK), or the hash of a script (SH). Here, we will discuss simple addresses derived from public keys through hashing, which are the most used on the BTC network.\nA simple address is obtained by successively hashing the serialized public key using the SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 functions. The composition of these two functions is commonly called HASH-160. RIPEMD-160 was chosen by Satoshi to shorten the length of addresses, as it produced 20-byte hashes instead of the 64 bytes of a public key or the 32 bytes produced by SHA-256. Denoting ( A ) as the address, we have:\n\\[A = \\text{HASH160}(K) = \\text{RIPEMD160}(\\text{SHA256}(K))\\]\nSince this composition is itself a hash function, it also has the characteristic of being a one-way function. Therefore, it is virtually impossible to retrieve the public key from the address.\nThe risk of collision is also statistically nil, even though there are fewer addresses than private keys. The RIPEMD-160 hash function produces 160-bit hashes, resulting in ( 2^{160} ) (approximately ( 1.4615 ^{48} )) possible addresses, which is roughly ( 8 ^{28} ) times fewer addresses than private keys. However, this number is sufficiently large that the risk of randomly landing on the same address is completely negligible12.\n12 Suppose a global population of 10 billion humans uses Bitcoin actively, with each individual generating 1 million addresses on average. The probability of a collision would then be: \\[10^{16} / 2^{160} \\approx 0.000000000000000000000000000000684\\%.\\] Even if an individual attempted to build a specialized machine generating and checking a trillion (( 10^{18} )) addresses per second operating continuously, the probability of accessing an already used address would still be negligible (on the order of ( 10^{-21} )). Our brains are not wired to comprehend such numbers.Since a public key has two serialized representations (compressed and uncompressed), it is possible to calculate two hashes. Here, we focus on the compressed representation. The hash of our compressed public key is:\na18bd7f41b42c7cc6ebfa4de43e6b63248536ebc\nFrom this, we can derive three different types of addresses: a legacy address, a native SegWit address, and a nested SegWit address. In all three cases, the principle is the same, although the specific use of the hash in the protocol differs.\nThe legacy address is obtained by encoding the hash in Base58Check with the version byte 0x00. Due to this version byte, simple legacy addresses always start with a 1 (purely symbolic since it equals 0 in base 58). Our address is:\n1FjBKPQ7MTiPSDkJ2ZwPgAXUKQ8yoGbVJX\nThis type of address is called P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash) and was the first type of address in Bitcoin.\nThe native SegWit address is encoded using the Bech32 format. This includes a prefix indicating the network (bc for BTC) and a separator (1). Similar to the encoding of legacy addresses, it involves taking the raw information (“payload”), prefixing it with the SegWit version byte (0x00 for the first version of SegWit), calculating a checksum, and expressing the whole in the appropriate base, namely base 32. This process results in the address always starting with bc1q. In the case of our public key hash, we obtain:\nbc1q5x9a0aqmgtrucm4l5n0y8e4kxfy9xm4udhygr2\nThis type of address is called P2WPKH (Pay to Witness Public Key Hash).\nFinally, we can also include this data in the form of a script in a P2SH address, creating a so-called “nested” SegWit address. The script, composed of the SegWit version byte (0x00) and the hash, is hashed to form the new address. As with all P2SH addresses, the resulting hash is encoded in Base58Check with the version byte 0x05. This version byte causes the address to start with a 3. Our hash becomes:\n3JqPHkGuvW7nsUJDgm5CPSNUb47WczCC5e\nThis type of address is called P2SH-P2WPKH (P2SH-nested Pay to Witness Public Key Hash). We will discuss in more detail the different script schemes underlying these address types in Chapter 12.\nOnce encoded, addresses can be easily shared from one person to another. Thanks to the checksum, a typo theoretically poses no risk, as the software will detect it and refuse to proceed with the payment. Addresses are also often represented by QR codes (see Figure 7.3), better suited for interaction with smartphones.\n\n\n\nQR codes of addresses.\n\n\nIn summary: when a user wants to receive a payment, they generate a private key, derive a public key from it, and create an address from the public key; they share their address with another user who sends them funds; they can then spend the received funds by signing a transaction using their private key. The Bitcoin peer-to-peer network then verifies that the signature matches the public key.\nThe public key is only revealed to the network during the transaction. This implies that funds are protected against the possibility of a faulty implementation of the signature algorithm (as in the case of exploiting the vulnerability within SecureRandom in 2013) or the generalized compromise of ECDSA (by a quantum computer, for example). This is a secondary benefit of using new addresses for each payment.\nBeyond BTC, other cryptocurrencies have their own encoding for addresses, often a variant of the standard modifying the version or prefix. Thus, in Litecoin, legacy addresses start with an L (e.g., LZx8abhwS7xSh2STChvgxBbEXcWG1AZ2iR), and SegWit addresses start with ltc1q (e.g., ltc1q5x9a0aqmgtrucm4l5n0y8e4kxfy9xm4uft7vm6).\nBitcoin Cash also has its own address format, called CashAddr, which is heavily inspired by the Bech32 format. This format was introduced to differentiate BTC addresses from BCH addresses. A BCH address is simply an alternative representation of the P2PKH type: in this format, the address 1FjBKPQ7MTiPSDkJ2ZwPgAXUKQ8yoGbVJX becomes bitcoincash:qzsch4l5rdpv0nrwh7jduslxkceys5mwhs03g7e6dq.",

    "section": "Wallets",
    "text": "Wallets\nA wallet is a method of storing private keys that grant access to a user’s cryptocurrency funds. This method is often combined with cryptocurrency management: receiving it by reading the blockchain and sending it by producing signatures. The medium used can be a simple piece of paper or a computer file, but it is generally software on a mobile device or computer, or a specialized device.\nA wallet is essentially a keychain. Its main role is to securely store private keys over time to guarantee ownership of bitcoins. Most of the time, keys are deterministically generated by these wallets from a 12- to 24-word recovery phrase. The user must therefore carefully preserve this phrase on another medium to recover their funds if their device is lost, broken, or stolen.\nHowever, an account with a custodian like a centralized exchange is not truly a wallet because these services hold their users’ private keys for security and ease of use. Thus, applications that closely resemble wallets, like the Wallet of Satoshi or the Coinbase app, are not.\nWe can classify existing wallets into two main categories: “hot wallets” that are connected to the Internet during use, and “cold wallets” that are never directly connected. Additionally, within these two categories, there are different types of wallets, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.\nHot storage of private keys, which uses devices directly connected to the Internet, includes software wallets that can be installed on a mobile device, tablet, or general-purpose computer. These software applications usually make their source code available to the public for obvious security reasons. Keys are stored on the computer and are generally encrypted. This category includes full node software, lightweight wallets, browser extensions, and web wallets.\nA full node implementation, also called a full client, is the first type of wallet that appeared and the only one that existed during Satoshi’s time. As its name suggests, such software performs all the operations necessary to maintain a node on the peer-to-peer network: it downloads the entire blockchain and verifies and relays unconfirmed transactions and blocks. Bitcoin Core is the most well-known full node software. However, due to its difficulty of use, this type of wallet is generally no longer used directly; novices prefer lighter applications, and advanced users favor more secure solutions that they can connect to their personal node if they wish.\nA lightweight wallet, also known as an SPV wallet (for Simplified Payment Verification), is software that does not download the blockchain but performs simplified transaction verification using the chain of headers, requiring few computing resources. This type of wallet is particularly suited to small devices like phones. The software can interact with all the full nodes in the peer-to-peer network, as BRD (formerly breadwallet) does, but generally goes through dedicated server infrastructure to make usage more pleasant, as is the case with Electrum or Sparrow. This type of wallet ensures the safety of funds but can have a detrimental effect in other areas, particularly regarding privacy. The user can also choose to connect their wallet to their own full node.\nA wallet can also take the form of a browser extension, whether on Chrome, Firefox, or Brave. Unlike lightweight clients, these wallets do not always perform transaction verification and trust the server they are connected to.\nFinally, the last type of hot storage is the web wallet. These are online interfaces that allow users to manage funds. Unlike exchanges, the user retains control of their private keys when using this kind of service: the keys are managed by the browser and are never revealed to others. The most well-known wallet of this type is Blockchain.com’s wallet.\nBut these hot solutions are not the only ones, and there are methods of cold storage for private keys that are completely disconnected from the Internet. This storage method has the merit of reducing the attack surface and thus the risk of theft through hacking. It is the recommended solution for securing large amounts of cryptocurrency.\nIdeally, you need a device that remains constantly offline to generate keys and addresses. This device can be an old computer not connected to the Internet or specialized hardware. The two main methods for cold storage are paper wallets and hardware wallets.\nA paper wallet is the simplest type of wallet imaginable: private keys generated offline (and their corresponding addresses) are written on a piece of paper. The information can also be a mnemonic phrase. The paper wallet has a major drawback: the inability to sign transactions without importing it into an online interface. This method is not practical at all because the user cannot sign transactions without compromising the security of their wallet and must be content with receiving payments. To solve this problem, hardware wallets exist.\nA hardware wallet is a device specifically designed to generate and securely store private keys and allow transactions to be signed offline. It is currently the safest way to hold bitcoin. These wallets are built so that someone who gets hold of them cannot spend the funds without the user’s password.\nThere is a variety of hardware wallets. The best-known are those from Satoshi Labs (the Trezor One and Trezor Model T) and those from Ledger (the Nano S and Nano X), which are the oldest and most recognized models. These can be safely connected to a computer, and transactions are always signed on the device. Some others enhance security by being physically isolated from any third-party computer (using an air gap), like the Coldcard Mk4. Other wallets focus on ease of use, such as Satochip cards that are based on smartcards.\nAll wallets involve a certain level of trust: you must rely on the software you use to store your bitcoins, the program you use to generate a paper wallet, or the hardware specialized in cold storage. Of course, open-source solutions can be considered safer in the sense that people other than the designers have been able to verify the final product, which is notably the case for many software wallets and the hardware infrastructure of Trezor wallets. In any case, a component based on reputation remains.\nIn general, each type of wallet has its utility: it’s up to the user to determine which wallet best suits their needs.",

    "section": "Key Derivation",
    "text": "Key Derivation\nDuring Bitcoin’s early days, private keys were randomly generated by the software each time it was used. Consequently, the keys were stored in a file called wallet.dat on the computer’s hard drive. This made key loss more likely.\nHowever, modern wallets no longer work this way. Keys and addresses are deterministically derived from a single randomly generated piece of information, which takes the form of a mnemonic phrase ranging from 12 to 24 words. These words can be in English, French, or another language.\nelder process crowd gentle proof taxi bean patient around warm source boil\nTherefore, preserving this phrase, called a recovery phrase, ensures the security of the bitcoins. This phrase allows you to recover your funds if your device is stolen or broken. That’s why it must remain secret.\nThis type of wallet is sometimes called an HD wallet for Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet. The concept was developed for Bitcoin starting in 2011. It was standardized in 2012 within BIP-32 written by Pieter Wuille and proposals BIP-39 and BIP-44 written by Marek Palatinus and Pavol Rusnak. It was expanded to other cryptocurrencies in 2014.\nGenerally, the secret phrase or recovery phrase is generated by the user’s device, whether it’s a mobile phone, computer, or hardware wallet. To do this, entropy is first created by the device in a pseudo-random manner. The information, which has a specific number of bits, is then enriched with a checksum of a few bits, allowing errors in input to be detected, and the whole is divided into 11-bit segments. Finally, each of these segments is associated with a word from the standard list of 2048 words, forming the phrase. This derivation is illustrated in Figure 7.4.\nThe number of words in the phrase depends on the desired entropy size. Thus, 128 bits of entropy is equipped with a 4-bit checksum, resulting in a 12-word phrase of 11 bits each. For 256 bits, there is an 8-bit checksum and thus a 24-word phrase.\n\n\n\nFrom entropy to the mnemonic phrase.\n\n\nVarious cryptographic processes are used to derive keys and addresses from this phrase. These derivation processes have similar properties to hash functions, producing irreversible, unpredictable, and collision-resistant results.\nThe first is the HMAC-SHA512 message authentication code (HMAC stands for Hash-Based Message Authentication Code), which calculates a hash using the SHA-512 hash function in combination with a secret key. The second is the PBKDF2 key derivation function (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2), which repeatedly applies a function chosen by the user to a message of arbitrary size with a cryptographic salt. The advantage is that it requires a significant amount of computation to prevent brute-force cracking of the higher-level information.\nIn Bitcoin, PBKDF2 is used to derive a seed from the mnemonic phrase by applying the HMAC-SHA512 function 2048 times. The cryptographic salt is the term mnemonic to which a passphrase can be added to enhance security. The resulting seed is 512 bits (64 bytes) of information, from which the master key and subsequent keys are derived.\nKey derivation is done using the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm. First, an initial derivation is performed from the seed. The HMAC is applied to the seed and the cryptographic salt Bitcoin seed, yielding a master key (first 256 bits of the result) and a master chain code (last 256 bits of the result). The transition from the secret phrase to the master private key and master chain code is summarized in Figure 7.5.\n\n\n\nFrom the mnemonic phrase to the master key.\n\n\nThese two pieces of information allow all subsequent derivations to be made. The chain code is used in the key derivation chain so that it’s impossible to perform the derivation without it.\nRather than managing these two pieces of information separately, it’s preferable to use extended private keys, which include the private key and chain code, as well as other information like the depth and index of the child key. The extended private key is encoded in Base58Check with a special prefix that depends on the type of address derived, resulting in the key starting with xprv (legacy addresses and Taproot keys), yprv (nested SegWit addresses), or zprv (native SegWit addresses). In our case, the extended private key derived from the master private key and master chain code is:\nxprv9s21ZrQH143K3KSN1mSK8myNuDcXNvNoCDcU4KBxMTuj1Wo83zNn\njaj8dKFT81GttcgPftdB4XhAzzQLXJEGDtFp35yssYnxDV3yVDEqv1b\nSimilarly, the extended public key groups the public key and the chain code corresponding to the private key from which it is derived. In Base58Check, this key always starts with xpub, ypub, or zpub. The extended public key corresponding to the master private key is:\nxpub661MyMwAqRbcFoWq7nyKVuv7TFT1nP6eZSY4rhbZuoShtK8GbXh3\nHP3cUapsPsqEd52TRk1vhkgkhtAReezgSBi4ELh3YoxjmZgKBk7U98h\nChild key derivation involves using the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm to derive “child” extended keys from a “parent” extended key. Chain codes are used as the cryptographic salt. There are two types of derivation: normal derivation and hardened derivation.\nNormal derivation involves the extended public key in the process, allowing two operations: obtaining the child extended public key from the parent extended public key, and obtaining the child extended private key from the parent extended private key. The functioning of this type of derivation is illustrated in Figure 7.6.\n\n\n\nNormal key derivation using HMAC-SHA512.\n\n\nThis feature of derivation is extremely useful for generating new addresses without compromising the root private key. A user can thus import the extended public key into a payment processor to verify their balance and generate new addresses without providing the private key. It also allows merchants to have employees receive payments at different addresses without worrying about fund security.\nHowever, this feature poses a potential risk: if a child private key is disclosed, knowledge of the parent extended public key (and thus the corresponding chain code) allows one to obtain all child private keys as well as the parent private key.\nThat’s why there is a second type of derivation: hardened derivation, which, unlike the first, is restricted to the calculation of child (extended) private keys, ensuring better security. This is depicted in Figure 7.7.\n\n\n\nHardened key derivation using HMAC-SHA512.\n\n\nEach derivation involves an index, encoded on 32 bits as a signed integer, where the sign bit indicates whether it should be hardened or not, and the value indicates the child key’s number. Thus, one can produce 2,147,483,648 (( 0 ) to ( 2^{31} - 1 )) normal child keys and 2,147,483,648 hardened child keys (( -0 ) to ( -2^{31} + 1 )) from the same parent key.\nConventionally, an apostrophe is used to denote this sign13. The index 2 indicates the third normal child key. The index 44’ indicates the 45th hardened child key.\n13 Sometimes the letter h (for hardened) is used.Successive derivations allow for the creation of derivation trees, where the position of each key can be found using a path—the derivation path. This is typically started with the letter m to indicate that we’re starting from the master private key. An example of a derivation path is m/84’/0’/0’/1/17.\nEach wallet can use its own derivation path. However, a standard has emerged—BIP-44. This simplifies the construction of multi-purpose wallets supporting multiple cryptocurrencies and allowing multiple accounts for each14.\n14 Not all wallets adhere to this standard. The BRD wallet (formerly Breadwallet), for instance, uses the path m/0’ to derive the main account, following the initial recommendations of BIP-32.In this standard, three hardened derivations are performed, followed by two normal derivations, to arrive at a private key and its corresponding address. Each derivation provides information:\n\nThe first derivation (hardened) defines the wallet’s purpose: 44 (referring to BIP-44) allows for deriving an account using legacy addresses, 49 (BIP-49) for nested SegWit addresses, 84 (BIP-84) for native SegWit addresses, 48 or 45 (BIP-45) for multisignature addresses, 86 (BIP-86) for deriving public keys related to Taproot, etc.\nThe second derivation (hardened) indicates the crypto-economic protocol and, by extension, the associated unit of account: the number 0 is used for BTC, 1 for the testnet, 2 for LTC, 60 for ETH, 128 for XMR, 145 for BCH, etc.\nThe third derivation (hardened) gives the account index: 0, 1, 2, etc.\nThe fourth derivation (normal) indicates the address role: 0 signifies an external address, used to receive bitcoins; 1 signifies an internal address, used to receive change when sending bitcoins (a phenomenon we’ll describe in Chapter 12).\nThe fifth derivation (normal) gives the key and address index: 0, 1, 2, etc.\n\nThus, the derivation path looks like this:\nm / purpose' / protocol' / account' / address_role / address_index\nFor example, the key m/44’/0’/0’/0/0 corresponds to the first receiving address of a Bitcoin account using legacy addresses. Similarly, the key m/84’/0’/0’/1/17 corresponds to the 18th change address of the first Bitcoin account using native SegWit addresses.\nAll addresses of a wallet remain valid even if they have been used. Although one can generate infinite addresses, the wallet usually scans 20 addresses from the last active address.",

    "text": "Property in Bitcoin\nProperty is the absolute control exercised over a good by a person to the exclusion of all others. Often, property is exercised through a property right that legally establishes the power dynamics. The owned good can be a book, a car, or land.\nProperty is fundamental to money: without real control over monetary units, exchange is impossible. Indeed, the transfer of precious metal coins or fiduciary banknotes requires that the holder fully controls them and can relinquish them at the time of the transaction. That’s why we also talk about liquid cash.\nWithout this property, the characteristics of money crumble. Today, most transactions involve the exchange of bank credit, whether through card payments, transfers, or other digital means. This situation exposes people increasingly to forms of censorship resulting from regulatory constraints and banking arbitrariness, such as prohibitions on sending transfers or freezing accounts without notice, in addition to the bank’s solvency risk.\nBitcoin allows individuals to fully own their money while retaining the digital and immaterial aspects of its use. This property is different from that exercised over objects: it is indeed inseparable from the exclusive knowledge of information (the private keys) and the protection of that information.\nThus, information is more valuable than ever. We’ve always associated value with knowledge due to the power it brings (scientia potentia est), but this value was indirect. Today, information can provide direct access to a certain amount of cryptocurrency: if someone knows the private key corresponding to an address containing bitcoins, they de facto own those bitcoins.\nA user can hold bitcoin extremely easily by memorizing the private key or recovery phrase. They can, for example, cross a state border possessing a piece of paper with the information, or simply keep it in mind. This is exemplified by a German criminal who, after fraudulently mining 1,700 bitcoins by installing software on computers without their owners’ knowledge, was able to keep his fortune despite his two-year imprisonment15.\n15 Clément Wardzala, “Bitcoin: the German police searching for a $65 million password”, Cryptoast, February 5, 2021: https://cryptoast.fr/bitcoin-police-allemande-recherche-mot-de-passe-65m/.A user can receive bitcoins by generating a new private key on a device. No authorization from the network is required, although they must, of course, have Internet access to verify incoming payments. Due to the system’s resistance to censorship, they can do whatever they want with their bitcoins: fund sensitive causes, buy drugs on the dark web, gamble online, send funds abroad, etc. There is no limit on the amount, providing a wealthy individual with a means to have a much greater impact on the world.",

    "section": "Custody Risk",
    "text": "Custody Risk\nEven though Bitcoin enables free exchange through cyberspace, it hasn’t eliminated trusted third parties. Indeed, many people lack confidence in their ability to store their bitcoins themselves and prefer to delegate this responsibility to custodial services, such as specialized custodians, online marketplaces, or payment apps. It’s also more convenient to use a bank to lend money and make it grow, which benefits online lending platforms.\nWhile this behavior is understandable, it’s important to emphasize that those who save bitcoins through a custodian do not actually own those bitcoins. The claim they have on the trusted third party is not ownership of the bitcoins since the custodian holds them. State law may intervene, but that doesn’t prevent this real control from manifesting in various cases. This is the meaning of the adage “not your keys, not your coins,” popularized by Andreas Antonopoulos16, reminding us that those who do not manage their private keys themselves do not truly own the bitcoins they believe they possess.\n16 Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin Q&A: How Do I Secure My Bitcoin? (video), July 7, 2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-zXEsJ61U.While delegating property offers certain advantages, it also has drawbacks and poses risks to those who do so. First, custodians can go bankrupt if their reserves become too low for withdrawal requests. In case of bankruptcy, the client does not recover all their funds unless another entity absorbs the platform’s losses.\nFirst, this bankruptcy can materialize following a loss of funds, as happened in July 2011 to the Polish exchange Bitomat, which lost the private keys linked to 17,000 BTC due to a technical incident.\nSecond, it can result from external theft, such as hacking. The most well-known example is the Mt. Gox exchange, which experienced multiple hacks between 2011 and 2013 leading to the disappearance of 650,000 bitcoins and went bankrupt in 2014. Creditors’ debts (in dollars) from the platform are expected to be repaid in 2024, ten years after the events.\nThird, this bankruptcy can result from an exit scam or internal theft, where the platform manager “runs off with the cash.” This type of incident was illustrated in July 2011 by the closure of the MyBitcoin service after the supposed theft of 78,740 BTC by its anonymous founder, Tom Williams. Another case is the Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX, which went bankrupt in 2019 following the death of its founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, who turned out to have spent the funds to finance his lifestyle and addiction to speculation. The bankruptcy of the popular exchange FTX in November 2022, following the fraudulent use of its clients’ funds, is another explosive example of this type of event.\nFourth, even if no loss or theft of funds occurs, fractional reserve operations by the custodian can push it into bankruptcy due to a credit tightening. This notably happened to lending platforms Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital, BlockFi, and Genesis Files in 2022–2023.\nFurthermore, besides the risk of bankruptcy, using a custodian carries the risk of state intervention. The platform, provided it operates in the legal market, complies with various AML/CFT regulations and may therefore be required to freeze an account or even seize the funds it holds. This is what Coinbase did on March 7, 2022, by blocking 25,000 addresses in the context of Western sanctions against Russia17. The platform can also be shut down by authorities, as was the case with BTC-e in July 2017, which was seized by the U.S. Department of Justice18.\n17 Paul Grewal, Using Crypto Tech to Promote Sanctions Compliance, March 7, 2022: https://blog.coinbase.com/using-crypto-tech-to-promote-sanctions-compliance-8a17b1dabd68.18 Department of Justice, Russian National And Bitcoin Exchange Charged In 21-Count Indictment For Operating Alleged International Money Laundering Scheme And Allegedly Laundering Funds From Hack Of Mt. Gox, July 26, 2017: https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/russian-national-and-bitcoin-exchange-charged-21-count-indictment-operating-alleged.19 Patrick Thompson, “Crypto exchanges delisting, denying access and stealing BSV”, CoinGeek, January 17, 2020: https://coingeek.com/crypto-exchanges-delisting-denying-access-and-stealing-bsv/.Finally, another drawback of using a custodian is the case of forks, which are permanent duplications of the blockchain creating two distinct currencies, and airdrops, which are free token distributions for advertising purposes. In both cases, the user’s address is credited with an additional asset that becomes their property. However, if the person goes through a custodian, the latter may choose not to transfer it to them, generally in a non-fraudulent manner, according to the criteria determined by the terms of use upon registration. Regarding forks, one can cite the example of the Bitstamp exchange, which refused to cede its users’ Bitcoin SV after the split between BCH and BSV in November 2018 and continues to hold them19. For airdrops, one can mention the case of HEX, an open Ponzi scheme, whose genesis in 2020 was partly determined by the possession of bitcoins: each bitcoin holder could claim an amount of HEX tokens proportional by publishing a digital signature on the Ethereum chain, but it seems that no platform took the risk of benefiting from this airdrop.\nThe non-distribution of the fruits of forks and airdrops thus represents a loss or at least a missed gain for the client, especially if it’s a split between two economies of equivalent size. However, nothing can force a custodian to offer the withdrawal of these gains, as the technical implementation has a significant cost. Conversely, platforms would be forced to support all such creations, including the most fanciful ones, like the opportunistic forks of BTC that took place in 2017–2018 (Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Private, etc.)\nIn general, relying on custodians has major drawbacks, meaning that the user does not benefit from Bitcoin’s resistance to censorship and inflation. Holding bitcoin on regulated platforms only allows them to enjoy the state’s temporary leniency regarding the transfers made and the realized capital gains. Moreover, the widespread custody of funds presents a systemic risk, as we will see. Therefore, resorting to custodians should be considered the exception rather than the rule when it comes to storing bitcoins.",

    "section": "Property and Responsibility",
    "text": "Property and Responsibility\nWhile Bitcoin allows users to own their money sovereignly, this ownership comes with responsibility. This user must understand how the system works, at least rudimentarily. They must choose which software and hardware to use. They must handle funds, verify addresses, and remain vigilant at all times. In the case of a fork without replay protection, they must themselves separate the coins on both sides. They are alone in the face of uncertainty and, above all, themselves. This responsibility is the price to pay for monetary freedom.\nIt’s understandable that some people lacking technical knowledge end up delegating this management, especially to speculate. However, the primary interest of Bitcoin is not to return to a banking system: it’s to fully own one’s funds without them being frozen by a trusted third party or diluted by monetary inflation.\nSince securing bitcoins is based on the knowledge of information, holding bitcoins is inextricably linked to the dilemma between data loss and data leakage. To keep their bitcoins, one must both maintain access to their private keys (avoid data loss) and exclude others from them (avoid data leakage), which can never be fully achieved.\nThis dilemma can only be resolved through a compromise between security against loss and security against theft, which is unique to each person. For example, someone might simply memorize their 12 or 24 words to hold their bitcoins, at the risk of forgetting them and losing them forever. Conversely, another person might keep multiple backups in different places, at the risk of a third party accessing one of them and seizing their funds.\nOn one side, we have bitcoin theft. This can occur through burglary: someone breaks into a home and takes the physical medium containing the backup or password. But it can also be carried out through intimidation: owners are physically attacked to be extorted. Hal Finney’s family, for instance, was targeted by a blackmailer who had them swatted by convincing special police units to intervene urgently at the family home.\nThere are best practices to avoid exposure to such theft. First, it’s essential to preserve confidentiality by avoiding declaring that you own cryptocurrencies, how much you own, for how long, etc. This advice also applies to exchanges, which know their clients’ identities and their withdrawal addresses and may disclose this information following a state request or a leak.\nThen, the user can improve their storage. They can avoid keeping backups in the most sensitive places (like their home). They can also distribute funds across wallets managed differently to mitigate the impact of theft, although this also increases the risk of such theft occurring.\nIt’s also possible to set up a secondary hidden account within a hardware wallet by exploiting the use of a passphrase. This is a feature that Ledger integrates into its products. This technique has the merit of creating “plausible deniability” to present to an assailant who threatens or tortures the holder.\nFinally, one can make bitcoin ownership collective, either explicitly by setting up a multisignature account where each participant has their own private keys or implicitly through Shamir’s Secret Sharing algorithm. This involves other people to make extortion more difficult.\nOn the other side, we have bitcoin loss, representing the opposite risk of storage. Loss is not a problem for the system per se. Indeed, it only reinforces bitcoin’s deflationary aspect: as Satoshi Nakamoto said, loss only “makes everyone else’s coins worth slightly more” and can be considered “a donation to everyone20.” However, it is certainly a problem at the individual level, and the loss of keys has long been the main risk for the user.\n20 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Dying bitcoins, 06/21/2010, 17:48:26 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=198.msg1647#msg1647.21 James Howells mined between February 15 (block 4,334) and April 24, 2009 (block 12,098). He accumulated his mining revenue at address 198aMn6ZYAczwrE5NvNTUMyJ5qkfy4g3Hi. As of April 26, 2009, this address contained exactly 8,000 bitcoins.22 Alex Hern, “Missing: hard drive containing Bitcoins worth £4m in Newport landfill site”, The Guardian, November 27, 2013: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/27/hard-drive-bitcoin-landfill-site.Some early miners thus lost the bitcoins they had mined. This is the case for James Howells, a British engineer who mined 8,000 bitcoins over just over 2 months in 2009 and lost the key granting access to them21. In the summer of 2013, he threw away his computer containing the wallet file, depositing it at a local landfill. He realized his mistake a few months later with the price increase and associated media coverage, but it was too late. His case was made public in November 2013 in a Guardian article22.\nAnother example (publicized in 202123) is that of Stefan Thomas, the German programmer who was paid in bitcoins to produce the first quality video on Bitcoin. After paying the fees for this video, he kept the rest in his wallet24. He backed it up on an encrypted USB key (IronKey) but eventually forgot his encryption password.\n23 Nathaniel Popper, “Lost Passwords Lock Millionaires Out of Their Bitcoin Fortunes”, The New York Times, January 12, 2021: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html.24 Stefan Thomas’s addresses are 1AYLzYN7SGu5FQLBTADBzqKm4b6Udt6Bw6 and 17eSZivDJpuJp9TxezTXVxkgLbsr3XZM1i. As of June 8, 2011, their combined balance was 7,003.21 bitcoins.Losses are therefore common, and precautions must be taken against this risk. The adoption of hierarchical deterministic wallets (HD wallets), where keys are derived from a single secret phrase, has greatly helped solidify security against loss. Before, one had to keep a file containing their private keys on a device; today, simply keeping this phrase suffices, making it easier to copy onto a physical medium.\nThe first measure to prevent loss is setting up multiple backups. The user can place the phrase in different geographical locations, ensuring they retain ownership of their bitcoins in case one of these places experiences a disaster (fire, flood, cyclone, etc.). They can use a simple paper or cardboard sheet or choose to engrave their words on a steel plate forged for this purpose.\nThe user can even, for their less-funded wallets, keep a digital backup on their computer (if possible, encrypting it) or in the cloud, significantly increasing the risk of theft but ensuring access to the bitcoins. This practice is generally discouraged, but it’s up to the individual to make the judgment.\nBitcoin’s programmable aspect can also be leveraged against loss. Systems for fund recovery can be implemented, as is done, for example, in the Liana wallet25. No standard contract of this type has yet become widespread, so this practice remains discouraged for novices.\n25 Jean-Luc (Bitcoin.fr), Release of version 1.0 of Liana, May 12, 2023: https://bitcoin.fr/sortie-de-la-version-1-0-de-liana/.It can be beneficial for the user to keep one or more records listing their different wallets, even the oldest ones, to avoid forgetting where their funds are. However, again, this record must not be found; otherwise, the funds could be more easily located.\nSimilarly, one should never delete a wallet backup, even if it appears empty. It could contain cryptocurrencies from forks or receive payments in the future (for example, if it includes a public donation address). It’s advisable “to set it aside and keep the old copy just in case26.”\n26 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Version 0.3.13, please upgrade, 10/03/2010 20:54:07 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1327.msg15136#msg15136.27 Pamela Morgan, Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning, Merkle Bloom LLC, 2018.Finally, the user must remember that they will die. Unless they wish to take their digital possessions to the grave, they need to set up an inheritance plan for their bitcoins for their heirs. There are multiple ways to do this, but the most reputable model is that presented by Pamela Morgan in her Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning27. It involves writing a letter in which the user includes contact details of trusted people to help their heirs (our loved ones are a priori not as comfortable as we are handling bitcoins) as well as an inventory of their assets (to recover backups and restore wallets). The letter is sealed and placed in a safe place, such as a personal safe, a bank vault, or with a notary.",

    "text": "The Byzantine Generals Problem\nThe issue of consensus is illustrated by the Byzantine Generals Problem, a distributed computing problem formalized in 1982 by Leslie Lamport, Robert Shostak, and Marshall Pease1. This problem addresses the challenge of unreliable communications and participant integrity in distributed systems, applying to cases where components of a computer system need to agree.\nThe problem is presented as a metaphor involving generals of the Byzantine army—the Eastern Roman Empire that lasted until 1453 following the fall of its western counterpart in 4762. These generals are besieging an enemy city with their troops, aiming to attack it. They can communicate only through orally relayed messages and must find a way to establish a common battle plan using this method. For instance, the generals may seek to coordinate an attack at dawn, sharing their intentions by sending the message “attack” to confirm the assault, or “retreat” to cancel it.\nHowever, a small number of these generals turn out to be traitors working for the enemy, attempting to sow confusion within the army. These traitors send contradictory messages to their counterparts to ensure that some loyal generals attack while others retreat at the moment of assault, leading to certain defeat, as illustrated in Figure 8.1.\nThe problem is to find a strategy (i.e., an algorithm) that ensures all loyal generals agree on the battle plan. The traitors will then retreat, but since their number is assumed to be limited, the attack will still succeed.\nThe situation makes achieving consensus difficult. Appointing a commander to whom subordinate generals would obey is not feasible because the commander could be a traitor. Lamport, Shostak, and Pease demonstrated that the problem can be solved absolutely if and only if the loyal generals represent more than two-thirds of all generals3; in other words, there cannot be more than one-third traitors within the army.\nThe metaphor of the Byzantine generals directly applies to distributed systems—that is, systems whose components are separated and must communicate to synchronize. The generals represent system components, the traitors represent faulty components, and the messages are data transmitted between components. The goal is to obtain an algorithm that can detect failures, known as Byzantine faults, and allow the other components to exclude them. The resulting resilience is called Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT); the system is said to be BFT-compliant.\nInitially, the problem was described for computer systems relying on components located in different places, where reliable data transmission is critical, such as aerospace and aviation systems4. But it also concerns (and is of interest to us here) peer-to-peer systems based on a horizontal network of participants, particularly crypto-economic systems like Bitcoin, where network nodes need to agree on the contents of a ledger. The objective is then to find an algorithm that allows all honest nodes to reach consensus in the presence of malicious (or “Byzantine”) nodes.\nBefore Bitcoin, the problem was solved using so-called “classical” algorithms based on the ideas of Lamport, Shostak, and Pease. The most well-known is probably the PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus algorithm, developed by Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov in 1999, which allowed a given number of participants to agree while handling thousands of requests per second with latency under a millisecond.\nLong before Bitcoin, Wei Dai and Nick Szabo considered using this type of algorithm for their electronic money systems, b-money and bit gold. Similarly, many crypto-economic systems still employ them today for performance reasons, such as Ethereum, whose consensus is based on the Casper FFG algorithm.\nHowever, these algorithms impose strong constraints: nodes must know all other nodes and must communicate with each other. As a result, nodes authorized to participate in the consensus must be selected before the algorithm is launched, usually through Proof of Authority (PoA) using a whitelist of nodes, or Proof of Stake (PoS) based on the amount of units owned or delegated. This implies less robustness because validators are known to everyone and are therefore more exposed to attacks.\nBitcoin addresses this problem differently, using a new type of algorithm: Nakamoto’s consensus algorithm based on proof of work. This method is more robust in the sense that network nodes do not need to know all other nodes, and no identification is required.\nSince Bitcoin’s primary role is the transfer of value, the goal is to agree on who owns what—that is, the state of the system. Satoshi Nakamoto’s proposed solution involves using a ledger recording all transactions made since the system’s launch: “The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions5.” This ledger, forming the system’s history, is organized as a succession of blocks of transactions, such that it is commonly called the blockchain. Network nodes each maintain a complete copy of the chain, transmitting its elements upon request.\nNew blocks are added to the chain regularly through the production of a proof of work. The actors performing this operation are called miners. Network nodes reach consensus by considering the longest chain as the correct one. Thus, as Satoshi Nakamoto wrote:\n“The proof-of-work chain is a solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem6.”\nThe innovative aspect of this algorithm is that it solves the problem probabilistically rather than absolutely7. Consequently, transactions included in the ledger are never strictly final but are considered such after a certain time, probabilistically speaking. This functioning requires only 51% honest validators, instead of the 67% required by classical algorithms.",

    "section": "Proof of Work",
    "text": "Proof of Work\nProof of Work (PoW) is a process that allows a computing device to objectively and quantifiably demonstrate that it has expended energy. This method is used to select computers for access to a service or privilege.\nProof of Work is a mechanism against Sybil attacks, making it difficult for an actor to create excessive identities to take control of the network. A Sybil attack is one where, in an open network based on a reputation system, profiles are duplicated cheaply to disrupt operations. This is a particularly prevalent issue on social media, where bot accounts are mass-created to boost the visibility of specific content.\nThe concept of Proof of Work was first described by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1992, in an article presenting a method to combat spam in email inboxes8. The term “proof of work” was introduced in 1999 by Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels9.\n8 Cynthia Dwork, Moni Naor, “Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail,” 1992.9 Markus Jakobsson, Ari Juels, “Proofs of Work and Bread Pudding Protocols (Extended Abstract),” 1999.10 Adam Back, “[ANNOUNCE] hash cash postage implementation,” March 28, 1997, 16:52:26 UTC: https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1997/03/msg00774.html; Adam Back, “Hashcash — A Denial of Service Counter-Measure,” August 1, 2002: http://www.hashcash.org/hashcash.pdf.Dwork and Naor’s idea was implemented by British cypherpunk Adam Back in 1997 with Hashcash, an algorithm that easily produces proofs of work using a hash function, mainly intended for email10. This implementation was later incorporated into Hal Finney’s reusable proof-of-work (RPOW) system implemented in 2004.\nHashcash’s Proof-of-Work algorithm involves finding a partial collision of the chosen hash function—that is, obtaining two messages whose hashes start with the same data bits. Starting from version 1.0 released in 2002, the goal is more precisely to find a partial collision for the zero hash, meaning finding a preimage whose hash starts with a determined number of binary zeros. Since the hash function is one-way (preimage resistant), such a result can only be achieved by testing possibilities one by one, which requires energy. The obtained preimage is called a proof of work.\nThe proof of work is performed by successively computing hashes of a string composed of base information and a varying number, called the counter or nonce. The base information generally includes context details indicating when the proof of work was produced (identifier, date, time, protocol, etc.) to demonstrate that the proof has not been previously used.\nLet’s take an example to illustrate this. First, we choose base information specific to the context: to produce a proof of work related to this book and its writing date, we might opt for the base information 20231031181000:BitcoinElegance:. Then, we determine the degree of the proof of work—that is, the number of binary zeros the hash must start with, here 16. Next, we search for the desired result by incrementing the nonce: at each iteration, we concatenate it with the base information and check if the hash of the whole satisfies the requirement. The work stops when the hash begins with a sufficient number of zeros; in this case, after 95,690 attempts. Our proof of work is thus:\n20231031181000:BitcoinElegance:95690\nAnd the corresponding hash, starting with 4 hexadecimal zeros (i.e., 16 binary zeros), is:\n0000387b99b1412e3cb6e49548cc0d11bdc797138e1a0f5ff095279a710b895a\nThe steps of this procedure are detailed in Table 8.1.\n\n\nSearching for the proof of work using the base information 20231031181000:BitcoinElegance:.\n\n\nNonce\nHash (SHA-256)\n\n\n\n\n0\n933c448c18e334c1cc5191f035d8581af611417578392b2d695d521c29b396d5\n\n\n1\n50530c98d1b171826b3d26fa5442e4ce7aa1f8a1277b71bc74d3adc1cd88b9ae\n\n\n2\nfa27ed560df22d676d69966c9a981c5adfc395b4e7f78ca54d2593a98fd2ea38\n\n\n3\n011692df53a84ecdddcd154de4f329e7311090580adb189e8360ea1729d75c99\n\n\n95,690\n0000387b99b1412e3cb6e49548cc0d11bdc797138e1a0f5ff095279a710b895a\n\n\n\n\nStatistically, this type of search requires trying 65,536 possibilities (\\(2^{16}\\)) to find a solution. On average, producing such a proof of work demonstrates that a commensurate effort has been made. Moreover, there is an asymmetry between production and verification, the latter requiring only a single application of the hash function and thus being low-cost.\nThe average production cost imparts a certain scarcity to proofs of work: the higher their degree, the harder they are to produce. This is why they can be used as quality markers for email, as in Hashcash, or as basic monetary units, as in bit gold and RPOW.\nBitcoin’s mining incorporates Hashcash’s proof-of-work process in a variant form: the goal is to find a hash less than a specific target value, rather than a hash starting with a determined number of zeros. This process is applied between blocks of transactions, so these blocks—or rather their headers, as we will explain below—constitute the proofs of work themselves.\nIn Bitcoin, the role of proof of work is twofold: to require a cost for creating new bitcoins and to ensure the network can reach consensus. On one hand, it aims to impose a cost on the unit of account. This echoes models that preceded Bitcoin, and it’s why Hal Finney went so far as to describe bitcoins as “POW tokens” in 200911. However, bitcoins are not exactly proofs of work in the sense that their production difficulty is variable, evolving according to the total computing power deployed on the network. Except in the edge case of the protocol’s minimum difficulty, the goal is to ensure that unit production requires energy, not to demand a fixed work cost. On the other hand, proof of work aims to guarantee network consensus by ensuring that honest nodes agree on who owns what. It limits access to block production: the selection of the validator (miner) is based on the amount of energy expended. Here, proof of work serves its role as a defense against Sybil attacks by preventing attackers from setting up a large number of nodes to control the system12.\n11 Hal Finney, “Bitcoin v0.1 released,” January 24, 2009, 16:48:03 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015036.html.12 “If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.This functioning means that the blockchain forms a chain of proofs of work, summarizing all the work done since inception. Thus, the chain creates a linear history that is difficult to alter, as we will see.",

    "section": "The Blockchain",
    "text": "The Blockchain\nThe blockchain is, as its name suggests, a data structure that groups all transactions made since the system’s launch. This structure is a series of timestamped and worked blocks of transactions. It begins with a genesis block, valid by default, from which blocks are counted: this index is called the height and indicates the block’s position in the chain in mining order. Blocks can also be counted in the other direction from the most recently mined block, in which case we speak of depth.\nEach block has a unique identifier that distinguishes it from others. This is obtained by hashing the block’s header (the data placed before the transactions) using double SHA-256. Each block contains the identifier of the previous block, so the blocks are linked to form a chain. Since only the header is involved in calculating the identifier, the blockchain can actually be reduced to a chain of headers, to which transactions are cryptographically linked. The identifier starts with a certain number of zeros, indicating that work has been required. Thus, the block itself constitutes the proof of work.\nAll blocks are organized the same way, so by examining one in detail, we can understand how the chain is structured. Let’s study a block from Bitcoin’s main version (BTC), taking as an example block height 751,005, mined on August 25, 2022, which contains six transactions.\nEach block breaks down into an 80-byte header containing its essential information and a raw sequence of transactions. By convention, the first transaction in the block is the coinbase transaction used to reward the miner for this block, as we will see later.\nThe header is divided into six elements: the block version, the previous block’s identifier linking it to the current block, a Merkle root that cryptographically binds all transactions to the header, the block’s timestamp, the network’s target value, and the nonce related to mining. The different pieces of information in the header are transmitted with a reversed byte order (called “little-endian”) compared to the standard reading order (“big-endian”). We present them here in the standard order.\n\nBlock Version\nThe block version indicates the set of rules the block adheres to. Historically, version 1 signified compliance with the rules originally defined by Satoshi. Versions 2 to 4 were used to enforce protocol changes between 2013 and 2015. Since 2016, this version field is used for miners to signal in the context of a soft fork implementation via BIP-9 or an equivalent mechanism. The version field of our block is:\n0b00100000000000000000000000000100\n\n\nPrevious Block Identifier\nThe previous block identifier links the current block’s header to the previous block’s header. In the case of the genesis block, this field is conventionally set to zero. In our block, it is the identifier of block 751,004, which is:\n000000000000000000073ad6c18c81f2f67b2ca5b5ace8d23cce95812af8c7b6\n\n\nMerkle Root\nThe third element of the header is the Merkle root, corresponding to the final hash of the transaction arrangement in a Merkle tree.\nA Merkle tree, also known as a hash tree, is a data structure conceptualized in 1979 by cryptographer Ralph Merkle to verify the contents of a data volume without inspecting all of it. In such a structure, data (forming the leaves of the tree) are arranged in a certain order and hashed individually:\n\\[H_A = \\mathrm{SHA256d}(~\\mathrm{tx}_A~)\\]\nThen, the resulting hashes are concatenated in pairs (the second hash placed after the first) and the combined hash is computed:\n\\[H_{A\\!B} = \\mathrm{SHA256d}(~H_A \\parallel H_B~)\\]\nThis process is repeated. If the number of hashes to combine is odd, the last hash is concatenated with itself:\n\\[H_{E\\!F\\!E\\!F} = \\mathrm{SHA256d}(~H_{E\\!F} \\parallel H_{E\\!F}~)\\]\nOnce only one hash remains, the tree is complete: the final hash obtained is the Merkle root.\nThe Merkle root of block 751,005 is:\n268a15b56fe847a067624bd0be186c375baccae9ac6db304438e9da657fe51d9\nIncluding the Merkle root in the header prevents anyone from modifying, adding, or deleting a transaction without altering the header itself and reproducing the proof of work. Thus, all transactions are attached to the header, ensuring the block’s integrity.\n\n\n\nRepresentation of a Merkle tree with six leaves.\n\n\nThis organization is particularly useful for lightweight wallets (known as Simplified Payment Verification or SPV wallets) that do not store the entire blockchain but only the chain of headers, which is much less voluminous (just over 62 MB as of November 2023). Indeed, to verify the presence of a transaction in a block, they can simply request the related branch information (Merkle path) and perform the hashes themselves13. For example, a user wanting to confirm the transaction \\(\\mathrm{tx}_D\\) needs only to request \\(H_C\\), \\(H_{A\\!B}\\), and \\(H_{E\\!F\\!E\\!F}\\) from network nodes and perform the necessary hashes to compare the obtained root with that in the header. This greatly reduces the load on lightweight wallets.\n13 Demonstrating that a leaf is part of a Merkle tree requires computing a number of hashes proportional to the binary logarithm of the number of leaves (\\(\\log_{2}(n)\\)), not proportional to the number of leaves \\(n\\). For a block with 3,000 transactions (a high average on BTC), this represents 12 hashes of 32 bytes to obtain and 12 hashes to compute.Since the activation of SegWit on August 24, 2017, each block contains an additional Merkle tree, subordinate to the classical transaction tree described above. This is the witness tree, which is the tree of transactions including SegWit transaction signatures (separated from classical transactions). The root of the witness tree is placed in the coinbase transaction, so it is included in the main Merkle root, ensuring the integrity of the whole.\n\n\nTimestamp\nThe timestamp indicates the date and time of the block’s construction as declared by the miner. Technically, it is given by the Unix time, which is the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC. For our block, the timestamp is \\(1661407005\\), corresponding to August 25, 2022, at 5:56:45 AM (UTC).\nThe miner cannot choose this timestamp arbitrarily. The declared time must be in the future relative to the Median Time Past (MTP)—the median of timestamps of the last 11 blocks, which generally lags about an hour behind real time—and must not exceed the receiver nodes’ clocks by more than two hours. This relatively permissive constraint allows the network time to remain reasonably consistent with reality.\n\n\nTarget Value\nThe target value is the maximum value that the block identifier can take for the block to constitute a valid proof of work. The smaller this target value, the harder it is to find a solution and mine a block. It is determined by the network according to the difficulty adjustment algorithm rules.\nThe target value is encoded as a floating-point number where the first byte represents a specific exponent and the next three bytes determine the mantissa. Here, it equals \\(\\mathtt{0x09ed88} \\times 256^{(\\mathtt{0x17} - 3)}\\), which is:\n00000000000000000009ed880000000000000000000000000000000000000000\nThis information also provides the block’s mining difficulty, which is inversely proportional to the target value. It is the quotient of the system’s maximum target value by the network’s target value14. The protocol’s minimum difficulty is therefore 1, and that of our block (rounded to the nearest whole number) is \\(28,351,606,743,494\\), representing a massive differential! It also gives the block’s amount of work, which is the average number of hashes needed to find a solution15.\n14 Denoting \\(c\\) as the target value, the difficulty is defined by: \\[d = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{max}}}{c}\\] where \\(C_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\mathtt{0x00ffff} \\times 256^{26}\\) is the network’s maximum target value.15 Mathematically, the work of a block is the quotient of the number of possible hashes by the number of hashes satisfying the problem. Denoting \\(c\\) as the target value, the work is: \\[T = \\frac{2^{256}}{c + 1} ~.\\]\n\nNonce\nThe nonce denotes the number that the miner varies to produce the proof of work. The word comes from the English expression “for the nonce,” meaning “for the occasion,” indicating its specific role16. The miner also varies an additional nonce within the coinbase transaction, as the nonce field is too small (8 bytes) for the current mining difficulty. The nonce of our block is \\(4,224,551,499\\).\n16 A popular etymology claims it’s a contraction of “number used once,” but this is incorrect.These last two parameters (target value and nonce) relate to the proof of work and are involved in formulating the mathematical problem solved by the miner. This problem presents as a mathematical inequality. Denoting \\(c\\) as the network’s target value and \\(\\mathrm{HB}\\) as the block header, the task is to find a nonce \\(n\\) such that:\n\\[\\mathrm{SHA256d} ( \\ \\mathrm{HB} ( \\ n \\ ) \\ ) ~ \\le ~ c\\]\nAs mentioned, the result is used as the block’s identifier. The proof of work is easily verifiable: each network member can, based on the block’s data, ensure the miner has found a valid solution. In our case, comparing the identifier and the target value, we indeed obtain a result satisfying the required inequality:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathtt{0x000000000000000000065aebf106c8824f4b565d54d6d6df32498b2b041cfd07} & \\le \\\\ \\mathtt{0x00000000000000000009ed880000000000000000000000000000000000000000} & ~\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\n\nDiagram of a Bitcoin block (with SegWit).",

    "section": "Mining Revenue",
    "text": "Mining Revenue\nOne of Bitcoin’s innovations is rewarding transaction confirmations using its internal unit of account. This feature creates an economic incentive encouraging miners to behave properly, contributing to the system’s robustness.\nThe reward for adding a block to the chain partly comes from the protocol’s monetary creation, hence the term “mining” used to describe this activity. The process is analogous to real-world gold extraction: miners deploy capital and expend energy to obtain new bitcoins. As Satoshi noted in the whitepaper:\n“The steady addition of a constant amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation17.”\n17 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.The second part of the reward comes from transaction fees paid by users, collected from the transactions included in the block. The total is forwarded to the miner when the block is verified and accepted by the network.\nMining is thus the economic activity of gathering transactions into a block, producing the proof of work, and broadcasting the result across the network. Here, we distinguish it from simple hashing, which involves only performing calculations to create the proof of work and can be done independently of transaction selection, particularly within mining pools. In this context, miners are individuals or groups performing the complete activity, and entities merely setting up machines and delegating their power over transaction selection are merely “hashers.”\nMining operates cyclically. First, the miner selects transactions from their node’s transaction pool (called the mempool). Then, they construct a candidate block by setting a header, assembling the transactions, and carefully creating a coinbase transaction that rewards them. They then vary the nonce and other elements of the candidate block to produce the proof of work. If they find a solution, they broadcast the block to the network as quickly as possible so other nodes can verify it and accept it as the new block in the chain. If not, and a new block is found in the meantime, the miner accepts it and abandons their candidate block. In either case, the process restarts with different transactions.\nThe mining reward is thus collected by the miner by including a coinbase transaction within the block. This must, by convention, be the first transaction of the block. It has a unique input that does not reference any existing transaction. The coinbase transaction is also called the base of the coin because it is from this that new bitcoins are formed. The miner directs this transaction to an address they control, so they are rewarded only if their block is valid in the eyes of the network. The reward the miner can allocate to themselves must be less than or equal to the sum of the monetary creation and transaction fees. Thus, the miner can choose to reward themselves less than what the protocol allows, although this lacks direct economic sense18.\n18 In December 2017, the miner of block 501,726 rewarded themselves with the tidy sum of 0 BTC!Monetary creation occurs entirely through the coinbase transaction. All bitcoins in the system result from a series of transfers starting with such a transaction.\nThe particularity of this monetary creation is that it’s fixed over time and isn’t proportional to the computing power deployed. This is made possible by the difficulty adjustment algorithm, which derives from the fact that the system acts as a distributed timestamp server. Indeed, since blocks are timestamped, it’s possible to measure their past production rate and adjust mining difficulty accordingly. As Satoshi wrote:\n“To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they’re generated too fast, the difficulty increases19.”\n19 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.20 In Bitcoin Core, the difficulty adjustment algorithm is described by the CalculateNextWorkRequired function in the file pow.cpp. The variation is limited to a factor of 4 (both multiplication and division) to prevent instabilities. The algorithm overestimates the deployed computing power because the elapsed time is measured over 2,015 intervals, not 2,016 as it should be.In Bitcoin’s main version, the targeted interval between each block (block time) is 10 minutes, or 600 seconds. The adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks, roughly every two weeks, based on the simple average block time over that period. The new target value is calculated20 from the previous target value (\\(c_{k-1}\\)) and the elapsed time since the last adjustment (\\(t_{k-1}\\)):\n\\[c_{k} = \\frac{c_{k-1} \\cdot t_{k-1}}{2016 \\cdot 600}\\]\nThanks to this adjustment, bitcoin has a determined monetary policy, not subject to the direct arbitrariness of a trusted third party or the amount of deployed capital. This characteristic differentiates it from fiat money (like the dollar), which is issued discretionarily by a central bank, or precious metals (like gold), whose extracted quantity varies and follows market demand in the long term. This monetary policy was precisely described for the first time by Satoshi Nakamoto in his launch email on January 8, 2009, where he wrote:\n“The total amount of coins in circulation will be 21,000,000. They will be distributed to network nodes when they create blocks, with the amount issued halving every 4 years.\nFirst 4 years: 10,500,000 coins\nNext 4 years: 5,250,000 coins\nNext 4 years: 2,625,000 coins\nNext 4 years: 1,312,500 coins\netc…\nOnce this sum is exhausted, the system can support transaction fees if necessary. It relies on open market competition, and there will probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free21.”\n21 Satoshi Nakamoto, “Bitcoin v0.1 released,” January 8, 2009, 19:27:40 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.html.This policy is, of course, coded into the system, where it is called a subsidy.\nThe main originality of this monetary policy is that monetary creation is abruptly halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years) during what is commonly called a halving. By 2023, three halvings had already occurred on the main Bitcoin network: the first on November 28, 2012, when the protocol’s subsidy dropped from 50 bitcoins per block to 25; the second on July 9, 2016, reducing it to 12.5 bitcoins per block; and the third on May 11, 2020, further reducing it to 6.25 bitcoins per block. The next halving is expected around April 2024, after which new bitcoins issued will be 3.125 per block. Unless the consensus rules change, the 33rd and final halving will occur around 2140, as the monetary creation per block will then fall below one satoshi, effectively zero when truncated to whole units.\nIn the long term, this atypical monetary policy makes bitcoin a fixed-quantity currency. Indeed, the maximum amount of bitcoins in circulation is expected to approach a limit over time: the famous 21 million cap. This is simply a deduction from the aforementioned issuance conditions, expressed mathematically by the convergence of the sums of amounts mined between halvings22:\n22 This convergence is illustrated by Zeno’s paradox of Achilles and the tortoise. The series \\(\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1/2)^i \\right)\\) converges to \\(1\\) as \\(n\\to+\\infty\\).\\[N_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{+\\infty} \\left( {210,000 \\cdot \\frac{50}{2^i}} \\right) = 21,000,000 \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{+\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^i = 21,000,000\\]\nThe 21 million limit is an upper bound: in the absence of a change in the consensus rules, it will never be formally reached due to the optional nature of the mining reward, the discrete nature of the units, and the irreversible loss of bitcoins. Additionally, bitcoins whose owners have lost their private keys significantly reduce the actual quantity of bitcoins in circulation, though this isn’t accounted for in the calculation.\nMonetary creation is thus intended to diminish and become negligible, and this will happen sooner than one might think. Indeed, by 2023, the number of spendable bitcoins had already exceeded 19.5 million. Therefore, logically, this subsidy should be replaced by the other source of miner revenue: transaction fees23.\n23 “Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be inflation-free.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, March 24, 2009.Transaction fees are commissions paid by users for confirming their transactions. Transaction fees can be paid directly by the sender (client) or indirectly by the recipient (merchant) through a discount on the sold product. They are collected by the miner on each transaction in the block according to an implicit rule: it is the difference between the transaction’s input amount and its output amount. This difference can be zero (free transaction), but it is always accounted for. Fees are added to the coinbase transaction indistinctly from bitcoins generated by monetary creation. Bitcoin thus incorporates an internal and optimized transaction fee system, avoiding unnecessary bloating of transactions and blocks.\nThe existence of transaction fees is intended to persist by design, even if they become very low. Contrary to Satoshi’s opinion, confirming a transaction generally has a cost, even marginal24, and a transaction that pays too few fees relative to the load it brings has no economic reason to be confirmed. Therefore, there’s no reason to imagine the blockchain stopping.\n24 The only conceivable case of a free transaction is a large consolidation transaction that would reduce miners’ load by significantly decreasing the set of unspent transaction outputs.Moreover, protocol rules usually restrict block space through an explicit limit on block size (or weight). This restriction creates a production ceiling that, when reached, causes a rational miner to select transactions paying the highest fee rates, all else being equal. Thus, in the case of network congestion, there’s an auction effect that can drastically increase the average fee level.\nAlthough fees are the main way envisioned to compensate miners in the long run, alternative financing methods have been proposed.\nThe first is tail emission, which involves maintaining a constant monetary creation over time to ensure mining revenue doesn’t drop too low25. Introducing this feature would alter bitcoin’s monetary policy and eliminate the 21 million cap, making it highly controversial.\n25 Peter Todd, “Surprisingly, Tail Emission Is Not Inflationary,” July 9, 2022: https://petertodd.org/2022/surprisingly-tail-emission-is-not-inflationary.For example, tail emission has been implemented in the Monero variant since 2015. It became effective on June 9, 2022, after which 0.3 monero are created per minute, representing an annualized monetary creation rate of 0.87% at that time. A similar tail emission exists in Dogecoin since 2015, at 10,000 dogecoins per minute, with an annualized rate of 3.7% as of November 2023.\nThe second proposed financing method is demurrage, or holding cost, which involves taxing currency that has remained idle for a given time26. Satoshi’s bitcoins, representing a significant financial windfall, are particularly affected. However, this would infringe upon Bitcoin’s property system, making it unlikely for this method to gain traction.\n26 Jorge Timón, “Freicoin: bitcoin with demurrage,” February 24, 2011, 11:56:03 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3816.msg54170#msg54170.",

    "section": "The Longest Chain",
    "text": "The Longest Chain\nNow let’s address the central topic of this chapter: achieving consensus through mining. As we have explained, mining is the process allowing miners to add blocks to the chain, for which they are rewarded. But we have not detailed how this enables reaching agreement in an antagonistic context, with malicious “Byzantine” actors present.\nNodes follow a protocol composed of network rules, allowing them to communicate, and consensus rules, concerning the form of transactions and blocks, which we will detail in Chapter 10. Nodes that violate these rules have their connections closed by their peers and are blacklisted if necessary. It is therefore impossible to have a transaction or block accepted by the network that is not valid according to the consensus rules.\nNonetheless, Byzantine nodes can sow discord while respecting the consensus rules by producing competing blocks. Indeed, nothing inherently prevents an attacker from producing valid transaction blocks not attached to the main branch and submitting them to the network.\nThis problem is solved through a simple yet effective principle: the longest chain principle. This was described by Satoshi in the whitepaper:\n“The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it27.”\n27 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.28 In reality, initially, it was indeed the chain with the most blocks that was selected. But this principle was redefined on July 25, 2010, in version 0.3.3 of the software to account for work.Network nodes agree by selecting the chain with the most accumulated work, which generally materializes as the chain with the most blocks28. When a chain with strictly more work is published, nodes follow that chain, whether it continues from the last one or references an older branch. This rule ensures nodes always follow the chain where a greater amount of energy has been invested. The consensus algorithm resulting from applying this principle is called Nakamoto’s Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm, in honor of its creator.\nThe best way to understand this algorithm’s functioning is to consider a fork in the chain. Such a fork can be created by a malicious actor but is usually generated accidentally when two distant miners each find a different block within a short time interval, and network nodes receive different blocks first. There’s then no way to differentiate between the two branches, as both are correct under the longest chain principle. This type of accidental fork is common and occurs occasionally on the network due to latency.\nThis situation and its resolution were described by Satoshi in the whitepaper:\n“If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie is broken when the next proof-of-work is found, and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch then switch to the longer one29.”\n29 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.The network goes through three stages. Initially, it behaves as expected: miners extend the longest chain, on which the rest of the nodes coordinate. Then, the conflict occurs: two correct branches coexist, and miners work to extend the chain from the block they received first. Finally, the fork is resolved: a miner finds a new block, and their chain, now longer, is accepted by the network.\nA reorganization then occurs, reconciling the network nodes. The block from the weaker branch is considered incorrect and set aside. We say this block is orphaned as it loses its attachment to the parent chain30. The stronger branch (with the most accumulated work) is considered the correct version of the chain.\n30 The somewhat ambiguous term “orphan block” was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first version of the software. It is also called an “uncle block” (referring to its lack of productive descendants) or a “stale block.”\n\n\nDiagram of a common chain fork.\n\n\nAll conflicts on the network are resolved this way, which imparts particular characteristics to Nakamoto’s algorithm and, by extension, to Bitcoin.\nFirst, this functioning imposes two major security constraints. The first is that the network’s mining security relies on the assumption that a majority of the computing power (“51%”) behaves honestly. As Satoshi explained:\n“The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes31.”\n31 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.The second is that the security of a given transaction is probabilistic and depends on its depth in the chain. The transaction is first verified by the network (zero confirmation), then confirmed within a block (one confirmation), and eventually considered irreversible, generally after six confirmations for ordinary amounts on Bitcoin’s main version. This constrains the user to estimate the number of confirmations they must wait for based on the desired security.\nThis particularity is reflected in mining through the coinbase maturity, which is the number of confirmations required before the coinbase transaction’s output becomes spendable. This constraint is implemented to prevent misuse of funds due to a shallow reorganization. The delay on the BTC network is currently 101 confirmations.\nNakamoto’s algorithm also has three main advantages. First, it has the benefit of an objective criterion to rely on: everyone can reconstruct the chain from the genesis block and confirm it is the correct chain. Even in the extreme case of a global and prolonged network partition due to war or natural disaster, the system can eventually recoordinate32.\n32 Satoshi Nakamoto, “Re: Anonymity,” July 8, 2010, 19:12:00 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=241.msg2071#msg2071.Second, it allows open participation in consensus: all that is required of a miner is a valid proof of work, making mining anonymous by essence.\nFinally, this proof-of-work algorithm ensures network robustness: a miner doesn’t need to know all other participants, allowing the network to be composed of tens (or even hundreds) of thousands of nodes.",

    "section": "Resistance to Double Spending",
    "text": "Resistance to Double Spending\nDouble spending refers to an actor successfully having two transactions accepted by the network in succession, intending to destabilize the system’s state and benefit from it in some way. The second transaction may cancel the first, wherein the malicious actor makes a transfer back to themselves.\nDouble spending poses a problem for unconfirmed transactions—that is, transactions that have been broadcast to the network, verified by nodes, and placed in their mempools but not yet included in a block in the chain. No consensus has been reached about these transactions, but a merchant may choose to accept them when the amounts involved are small33. The risk is that a fraudster walks away with the goods and manages to have an alternative version of the transaction accepted by the network, either by broadcasting it simultaneously and hoping it reaches the miner first, by paying higher fees (which can be systematically done with Replace-by-Fee) to bribe the miner, or by pre-mining a block containing the transaction (Finney attack34).\n33 In a forum message in July 2010, Satoshi wrote about accepting unconfirmed transactions: “I think it will be possible for a payment processing company to provide a service of rapid transaction distribution with sufficient verification in 10 seconds or less. Network nodes accept only the first version of a transaction they receive to include in the block they’re working to generate. When broadcasting a transaction and someone else broadcasts a double-spend at the same time, it’s a race to propagate to as many nodes as possible. If one has a slight lead, it spreads geometrically faster on the network and reaches most nodes. […] The payment processor has connections to many nodes. When it receives a transaction, it sends it out and at the same time monitors the network for double-spends. If it receives a double-spend on any of its many listening nodes, it reports the transaction as bad.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, “Re: Bitcoin snack machine (fast transaction problem),” July 17, 2010, 22:29:13 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423.msg3819#msg3819.34 Hal Finney, “Re: Best practice for fast transaction acceptance - how high is the risk?,” February 13, 2011, 21:48:44 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3441.msg48384#msg48384.The solution to this problem is to agree on the correct transaction to eliminate the double spending—which is precisely the purpose of mining. However, mining does not prevent double spending absolutely; it is rather a resistance mechanism. Let’s examine what guarantees this characteristic.\nA number of opportunistic disruptions can occur in mining activity, such as the vector76 attack35 or selfish mining36, but the most significant is the double-spending attack through chain reorganization. This involves using a significant portion of the network’s computing power (usually a majority) to rewrite the chain’s past and modify one or more transactions. This attack was precisely described by Satoshi Nakamoto in the whitepaper37 and in his email response to John Levine on November 3, 200838.\n35 vector76, “Re: Fake Bitcoins?,” August 17, 2011, 17:37:56 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=36788.msg463391#msg463391.36 Ittay Eyal, Emin Gün Sirer, “Majority is not Enough: Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable,” 2013.37 “We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if successful, it does not open up arbitrary modifications […] An attacker can only try to modify one of his own transactions to recover the money he recently spent.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.38 “Even if a malicious individual managed to control the network, it’s not like he’s instantly rich. All he could do is get back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check. To exploit this, he’d have to buy something from a merchant, wait for it to be shipped, then take over the network and try to get his money back. I don’t think he could make as much money trying to pull a stunt like that as he could by generating bitcoins. With such a large botnet, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, “Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,” November 3, 2008, 16:23:49: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014818.html.This attack is carried out in three steps. It can be executed using a minority of computing power, in which case it only has a certain probability of success. However, for simplicity, we’ll assume a miner has gathered the majority of the network’s computing power. The attack thus constitutes a 51% attack, also known as a majority attack.\nThe first step is purchasing a good or service from a merchant. The attacker conducts a legitimate bitcoin transaction in exchange for which the merchant provides something of equivalent value—typically another cryptocurrency or dollars from an exchange platform.\nThe second step involves mining a parallel chain. Once the legitimate transaction has been confirmed within a block, the attacker constructs a parallel chain in secret from the previous block, carefully not revealing it to the rest of the network. Simultaneously, they create and sign another transaction (the “fraudulent” one) spending the same bitcoins as the first but sending them to an address they control. They include this fraudulent transaction in their parallel chain. Since the attacker controls the majority of the network’s computing power, they are sure that, at some point, this chain will be longer than the other.\nThe third step is the chain reorganization, depicted in Figure 8.5. The attacker continues to mine their parallel chain until the good or service purchased is delivered. At that point, they reveal their chain to the rest of the network, which must accept it under the longest chain principle. Nodes then reorganize: blocks from the old chain are discarded (orphaned), their transactions returned to the mempool, and the new blocks are verified and added to the chain. Since the legitimate transaction spends the same funds as the fraudulent transaction included in the new chain, this legitimate transaction is invalidated as a double spend. The merchant no longer owns the bitcoins, which revert to the attacker.\n\n\n\nDouble-spending attack through chain reorganization.\n\n\nThis is an opportunistic attack: it is motivated by gain—namely, the acquired good or service—which must exceed the cost (material, logistical, electrical, and software) necessary to carry it out. On the main Bitcoin network, this cost amounts to billions of dollars today39.\n39 Braiins, “How Much Would it Cost to 51% Attack Bitcoin?,” January 11, 2021: https://braiins.com/blog/how-much-would-it-cost-to-51-attack-bitcoin.This attack must be distinguished from censorship, which we will describe in Chapter 9 and involves refusing to confirm transactions based on arbitrary criteria. The latter relies on incentives external to Bitcoin’s economy, as a rational miner has no economic reason within the system not to include transactions paying a sufficient fee rate in their blocks.\nAs Satoshi emphasized, the system is secure as long as the majority of computing power is associated with honest nodes—that is, nodes not seeking to double-spend or censor. Mining security thus relies on a security barrier representing the financial burden on the attacker to execute a double-spend.\nThis barrier is not constructed benevolently but rests on the protocol’s reward, making mining an essentially economic process. Specifically, resistance to double spending—that is, the difficulty of executing a double-spend attack—directly derives from the total mining revenue, which incentivizes nodes to remain honest. As Satoshi wrote in the whitepaper:\n“The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it’s more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favor him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth40.”\n40 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.Not only might the reward exceed the gain from a double-spend attack, but the value of the bitcoins used in the transaction could also decrease due to the attack itself. Indeed, if the attack were successful, various actors might lose confidence in the system, stop using it for commerce, and sell some of their savings, causing the bitcoin’s exchange value and mining revenue to drop. Moreover, the specialization of mining hardware (when it exists) increases the attack’s cost, as such hardware loses utility value. From a purely opportunistic standpoint, it is thus usually more profitable to use one’s capital honestly.\nIt has happened that mining aggregates have accumulated more than 51% of computing power—like the GHash.io pool in July 2014—without any attack occurring. Even if such an attack took place, it wouldn’t necessarily be fatal for the system in the long term. As Satoshi wrote:\n“Even in the event of an attack, it does not enable arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes will not accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them41.”\n41 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.Thus, numerous such attacks have occurred on some Bitcoin variants over the years, reducing their reputations in the process, but without annihilating them. Notably, Ethereum Classic experienced several aggressive reorganizations between 2019 and 2020.",

    "section": "The Mining Industry",
    "text": "The Mining Industry\nMining is an economic activity in its own right, with the mining reward compensating miners for the service they provide. This reward pays for electricity costs, hardware and logistical infrastructure, and software maintenance. It compensates for the risk of producing orphaned blocks. It remunerates the confirmation of censored transactions. And finally, it rewards the temporary renunciation of liquidity (the lender’s originary interest) and general economic risk (the entrepreneur’s profit).\nOn the hardware side, miners need to deploy various components: hashing machines (including cooling systems) to perform the calculations related to proof of work; processors to process blocks and verify signatures; memory to store the chain (history), the set of unspent transaction outputs (state), and the pool of pending transactions; bandwidth to send and receive transactions and blocks; and so on. It’s evident that all this has become industrialized over the years.\nThe improvement of hashing machines illustrates this industrialization well. Initially, miners used their computer’s central processing unit (CPU) to mine. Then, in 2010, under the impetus of Laszlo Hanyecz and later ArtForz, mining with graphics processing units (GPUs) developed. In 2011, the first field-programmable gate array (FPGA) dedicated to mining appeared, offering better efficiency than graphics cards. Finally, in 2013, the first application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) hit the market with the release of the Avalon ASIC. From then on, ASICs became increasingly powerful, notably due to work by the Chinese company Bitmain on its Antminers.\nSome actors began industrial mining by piling this hashing power into large specialized warehouses containing hundreds of machines, known as mining farms. These farms were installed in locations considering specific factors, including electricity cost, temperature (cooling costs), bandwidth, and political stability. This emergence of mining farms composed of specialized equipment had been anticipated by Satoshi, who wrote as early as November 2008:\n“At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network, and the rest of the local network connects with that one node42.”\n42 Satoshi Nakamoto, “Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,” November 3, 2008, 01:37:43 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014815.html.As a result, the network’s computing power exploded. The hash rate, measured in hashes per second (H/s), experienced spectacular growth over the years. In 2009, it fluctuated between 1 and 7 million hashes per second (1 MH/s). During the first half of 2010, it increased to reach 200 MH/s in early July. It then underwent two major increases coinciding with speculative booms but also with the use of optimized methods. The first was in 2010–2011, when the price rose from less than a penny to $30, and the first GPU farms were used: between July 2010 and August 2011, the hash rate went from 200 MH/s to 15 TH/s (a 75,000-fold increase). The second was in 2013–2014, when the price nearly increased 100-fold and the first ASICs were deployed: the hash rate rose from 25 TH/s in January 2013 to 300 PH/s in December 2014 (a 12,000-fold increase). The hash rate then slowly increased to about 450 EH/s in November 2023 (a 1,500-fold increase since December 2014).\nWith this enormous growth in computing power, mining difficulty followed suit. By 2010, it became difficult to hope to mine a block with a personal computer’s CPU. This disadvantaged small miners. The increased difficulty highlighted an inherent flaw in mining: the variance defect. Since mining is subject to probabilities, an individual miner with a performant ASIC might not find any block at all, or might find more blocks than expected, making their income dependent on chance.\nTo correct this variance defect, mining pools emerged. These are groups of hashers who delegate their power over transaction selection to an operator to collectively contribute computing effort and smooth their income. Pool mining is based on producing partial proofs of work (PPoW) implemented by the Stratum protocol. Hashers produce lower-degree proofs of work for a given candidate block to prove they have expended energy and are compensated accordingly by the pool. The pool receives the mining reward each time a partial proof of work produced by a hasher also turns out to be a full proof of work (FPoW).\nThe first mining pool was launched on November 27, 2010, by Marek Palatinus (also known as “slush”). Initially called Bitcoin.cz Mining, it was later renamed Slush Pool in honor of its founder and became Braiins Pool in September 2022. Today, mining pools are numerous and concentrate most of the network’s computing power. They are generally based in jurisdictions where mining is prevalent, such as China (until 2021) or, more recently, the United States.\nPools often signal the blocks they mine for transparency. For example, the coinbase transaction of block 751,005 contains the string poolin.com, indicating that this block was likely validated by the Chinese pool Poolin. This signaling is not mandatory (mining is inherently anonymous) but provides an idea of the distribution among different pools (as seen in Figure 8.6) and allows estimation of the centralization of mining activity.\n\n\n\nApparent BTC hash rate distribution among mining pools for the week of October 5–12, 2023. (source: coin.dance)\n\n\nAnother inherent flaw in mining is the latency associated with block announcements. As explained in the section on the longest chain, this latency produces orphaned blocks, which are valid but not attached to the main chain. This means poorly connected miners have an apparent hash rate lower than their actual hash rate.\nTo mitigate the effects of this flaw, miners have established communication relays allowing them to send blocks to each other more efficiently by removing the denial-of-service protections necessary on the open peer-to-peer network.\nThe first relay was created by Matt Corallo under the name Bitcoin Relay Network. It was launched in 2013 and became fully operational in 2015. The network comprised several specialized nodes hosted on Amazon Web Services infrastructure. A competitor was the Falcon network, managed by a team from Cornell University led by Emin Gün Sirer. The Bitcoin Relay Network was replaced in 2016 by the FIBRE network43 (Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine), a network based on UDP (an alternative protocol to TCP) that implements the cmpctblock optimization, still managed by Matt Corallo. This network is used by most miners today.\n43 Matt Corallo, “The Future of The Bitcoin Relay Network(s),” July 7, 2016: https://bluematt.bitcoin.ninja/2016/07/07/relay-networks/.This industrialization of mining has led to centralization in both hashing power (mining farms) and transaction selection (pools and relays). While this aggregation is not fatal (hashers are free to leave one pool for another, and miners are free not to use the relay), it nonetheless reduces the chain’s mining security.\nCertain improvements have been proposed in mining to address this issue. The first is the P2Pool protocol, a cooperative mining protocol based on a peer-to-peer network of miners. It connects hashers using a side-chain—the “share chain”—with lower difficulty, grouping participants’ contributions. Development of P2Pool on the main Bitcoin version appears to have been suspended in 2017. However, the process has been implemented on Monero since October 2021 through a pool of the same name.\nThe second is the Stratum V2 protocol44, which allows (among other things) hashers to negotiate block content. While it doesn’t completely correct delegation in transaction selection, this new version of Stratum has the merit of making the process more transparent. As of November 2023, it was deployed only within the Braiins Pool (formerly Slush Pool), which is behind its design.\n44 Braiins, “Stratum V2 Protocol Overview”: https://braiins.com/stratum-v2#job-selection.However, these proposed improvements, while commendable, do not eliminate the economic advantage derived from centralization, which is also found in all industries (economies of scale). Decentralization has a cost, justified only when the benefit it brings surpasses it—that is, when the network is truly under attack.",

    "title": "9  Resistance to Censorship",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What Do We Mean by Financial Censorship?\nAt first glance, the notion of censorship might seem odd when discussing money. Commonly, censorship refers to the restriction of expression, particularly through the prohibition of disseminating certain ideas. However, we can understand it in a broader sense that intertwines payment and expression.\nThe term “censorship” comes from the Latin censeo, meaning “to evaluate,” “to estimate,” “to declare,” or “to judge.” It originates from a significant institution of the Roman Republic: the censors, two magistrates tasked with conducting a census of citizens and their property (census), collecting taxes, supervising public works, managing the list of those admitted to the Senate (album senatorium), and ensuring the maintenance of “good morals” among the population by administering reprimands or temporary penalties. The censors’ first function gave rise to the term “census.” The second led to concepts like “cens” (property assessment) and censitary suffrage. The last function sparked what we now call censorship.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Latin word censura was adopted by the Catholic Church to take on a religious meaning, focusing solely on speech—particularly texts. Censorship then resembled a reprimand (a sense still sometimes used today, especially in literary criticism) or a prohibition. It involved reviewing and correcting written works to ensure they conformed to the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church.\nHowever, the advent of the printing press in the 15th century disrupted this control: the number of books exploded, diminishing the Church’s grip over publications—a control that transitioned to the State. Consequently, censorship acquired its current political meaning, referring to the State’s examination of books, newspapers, plays, etc., to permit or prohibit their publication or performance. Over time, the term came to denote any infringement on freedom of expression, regardless of the medium, whether enacted before (a priori censorship) or after (a posteriori censorship) dissemination.\nWith the rise of mass media (newspapers, radio, television) and especially social media, the term has broadened further. Censorship now often refers to any editorial decision made by a private entity regarding its customers or users. While this private censorship isn’t an infringement on freedom of expression in the strictest sense, it becomes problematic when the field is monopolized by a few actors who often benefit from legal advantages or state subsidies. Moreover, such censorship can directly stem from political intervention, with platforms merely implementing government directives1.\nFurthermore, censorship of expression can be executed by hindering the economic activity of the speaker. By restricting someone’s ability to earn money and signaling that their speech is problematic, one can compel them to silence themselves. This context gave rise to the concept of financial censorship, defined by the international organization Students for Liberty as “restricting a private entity’s financial activity to inhibit its operations, with the implicit intention of silencing it”2. The Electronic Frontier Foundation shares this definition.\nHowever, the repercussions of financial control extend beyond expression and can affect human action in general. Financial censorship can thus be understood more broadly, as adopted by three researchers from San Jose State University who state: “Financial censorship occurs when a financial institution denies its services to a party because of that party’s expressed opinions, actions, or industry”3.\nFinally, financial censorship can be seen as the financial restriction itself, provided it rests on an external subjective criterion (adherence to arbitrary norms) rather than an objective economic factor like paying a commission. Censorship can be public (legal prohibition of a transaction), private (by a bank, for example), or both. This definition still embodies the idea of shaping individual behavior through financial intervention—a meaning attributed to censorship in Bitcoin.\nIn general terms, financial censorship involves directly restricting an entity’s financial activities to inhibit its expression or actions. The aim is to influence individuals by controlling the money they use, a tool essential for their economic survival. Today, censorship primarily targets bank credit, with transfers heavily regulated by authorities. In the future, it could extend to digital currencies managed by central banks.",

    "section": "Banking and Censorship",
    "text": "Banking and Censorship\nFinancial censorship operates through control over monetary transfers, making it difficult to apply such censorship to physical cash. Cash (in the form of precious metal coins or banknotes) enables direct, confidential, person-to-person exchanges, preventing most restrictions except in specific cases.\nIn contrast, banking involves clients holding accounts where banks record credits and manage transfers. This setup makes financial restrictions much easier: banks can select which transfers to process, temporarily freeze accounts, and even refuse cash withdrawals. The same applies to services built atop the traditional banking system, like PayPal.\nThus, the increase in financial censorship naturally coincided with society’s bankization, which began in the 1960s in the West. This era saw the widespread adoption of checking accounts and related payment methods like checks, credit cards, and transfers. Over a few decades, payments shifted to the banking sector, encouraged by law and offering more convenience than cash—which itself faced legal restrictions. As a result, censorship became more effective: if cash no longer allows people to manage their affairs adequately, opting out of the banking system is no longer viable.\nThis censorship was implemented through financial surveillance, now commonplace in the banking industry. Banks are legally obligated to monitor their clients and intervene upon detecting “suspicious” behavior, whether by blocking transfers or freezing accounts. They don’t do this willingly; instead, they aim to protect themselves from potential regulatory complications, not to “protect” their clients.\nRegulations tightened as banking became more widespread. Starting in the 1970s, combating money laundering—especially in the context of the war on drugs—became the primary justification for imposing restrictions on banks. In the U.S., banking regulations significantly tightened after the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 aimed at fighting money laundering.\nWith the Internet’s emergence in the 1990s, international banking usage required increased regulation. Various surveillance organizations were established. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body issuing recommendations on regulatory standards and economic sanctions, was created in July 1989 to combat money laundering. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury collecting and analyzing financial transaction information, was established on April 25, 1990. France’s equivalent, TRACFIN (Treatment of Intelligence and Action Against Illicit Financial Circuits), appeared in July 1990. The European Union’s first directive on preventing the use of the financial system for money laundering dates back to June 10, 1990.\nAfter the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a new pretext emerged: combating the financing of terrorism. In the U.S., this materialized as the PATRIOT Act in October 2001, with Title III addressing financial restrictions. In France, the law of November 15, 2001, on daily security reclassified “the act of financing a terrorist enterprise” as an act of terrorism itself4. Financial surveillance intensified accordingly.\n4 French Penal Code, Article 421-2-2, November 15, 2001.These developments form the foundation of what’s generally known as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) standards. This tightening is characterized by Know Your Customer (KYC) practices, also called customer due diligence, which involve verifying each client’s identity, compliance, and associated risks. Today, this identification requirement is integrated into all financial services.\nAs a result, bank secrecy—the obligation for banks not to disclose client information to third parties—has effectively disappeared, even in Switzerland. Using a bank account today presupposes comprehensive transaction surveillance and meticulous scrutiny of unusual operations. Transferring large sums without justification has become impossible.\nThis financial environment was summarized in January 2009 by Jonathan Thornburg, responding to Satoshi Nakamoto on a mailing list about the potential uses of Bitcoin:\n“In the modern world, no major nation wants to allow untraceable international financial transactions beyond a relatively modest threshold. (Common buzzwords include ‘drug money laundering,’ ‘tax evasion,’ and/or ‘terrorism financing.’) As a result, electronic financial transactions are currently monitored by various nation-states and their agencies, and all but the smallest transactions are now subject to various identification requirements for the parties at each end”5.\n5 Jonathan Thornburg, Re: Bitcoin v0.1 released, January 17, 2009, 16:49:45 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015016.html.",

    "section": "Instances of Financial Censorship",
    "text": "Instances of Financial Censorship\nIn recent years, notable cases of financial censorship have multiplied, making exhaustive listing impossible. We’ll highlight some prominent examples in the West, keeping in mind that those affected often don’t publicize this censorship.\nPerhaps the most well-known example is the financial blockade against WikiLeaks, initiated by Mastercard, Visa, Western Union, Bank of America, and others in December 2010 to silence the organization. By October 2011, WikiLeaks reported that the blockade had cut off 95% of its revenue. This event had direct repercussions in Bitcoin’s history, as recounted in Chapter 1.\nAnother case targeting specific professions was Operation Choke Point, conducted between 2013 and 2017 by the U.S. Department of Justice. The operation aimed to “choke off” certain industries by restricting their access to credit and other banking services. Activities deemed “high-risk” included pawn or payday lending, gambling, pornography, escort services, as well as the sale of tobacco, pharmaceuticals, coins, dating services, and even travel clubs. Arms and ammunition sales were also targeted. Defense Distributed, the libertarian crypto-anarchist Cody Wilson’s company specializing in distributing 3D-printed firearm designs, faced account closures from Chase, PayPal, and Stripe in 2015.\nIn 2018, political opinions became a censorship target. Numerous American alt-right personalities and organizations were banned from social networks and lost access to financial services. The most emblematic case was Alex Jones, founder of the alternative news site InfoWars, who, besides being purged from social media in the summer of 2018, had his PayPal account closed. Other examples include the social platform Gab (banned from PayPal, Stripe Cash App, and Coinbase), Milo Yiannopoulos (banned from PayPal for a Nazi salute), and Robert Spencer (blogger of the anti-Islam site Jihad Watch, ousted from Patreon under Mastercard’s pressure). In France, this censorship targeted Égalité et Réconciliation, the association of anti-Zionist Alain Soral, which was excluded from PayPal in August 2018 during a similar purge. The association also saw multiple bank accounts (Banque Postale, BNP Paribas, Banque Populaire) closed over the years.\nIn the political realm, but in China, the movement against the Hong Kong government’s proposed extradition law amendment—from March 2019 to July 2020—faced interventions from the international banking giant HSBC, likely under pressure from the central Chinese government. In November 2019, HSBC’s Hong Kong subsidiary closed an account used to support the protest movement. Then, in December 2020, it froze the account of democrat Ted Hui. By 2023, it emerged that HSBC was denying Hong Kongers who fled to the UK access to their pension funds, totaling £2.2 billion.\nMore recently, the COVID-19 pandemic provided additional examples of financial censorship. Activists opposing measures like lockdowns, mask mandates, and mandatory vaccinations faced extensive censorship, often accused of spreading misinformation. The Dutch action group Viruswaarheid—opposing social distancing, lockdowns, curfews, and vaccination programs—had its donation-receiving bank account closed by ING Bank in February 2021.\nA standout event is the Canadian “Freedom Convoy” of February 2022, initiated by truckers protesting mandatory vaccinations for cross-border travel. They converged on Ottawa to express their discontent. The movement encountered severe financial censorship. Initially, crowdfunding platforms canceled campaigns intended to support the truckers’ journey: GoFundMe withdrew a campaign that had raised 10 million Canadian dollars on February 4; funds raised through campaigns on the Christian platform GiveSendGo (around 9 million dollars) were frozen by the Ontario government and couldn’t be distributed. Financial repression escalated when, following the state of emergency declared by Justin Trudeau on February 14, the Canadian government froze personal and business bank accounts linked to the movement: 280 accounts containing a total of 8 million dollars were frozen. The following year, Judge Paul Rouleau, heading the Commission on the State of Emergency, stated that freezing bank accounts was a “powerful tool to discourage participation [in the protests] and encourage protesters to leave”6.\n6 Rob Gillies, “Judge: Canada right to invoke emergency act in truck protest”, Associated Press News, February 17, 2023: https://apnews.com/article/canada-government-justin-trudeau-ottawa-montana-9c1e37aa86d4315703e69f7794637e7f.Another significant event was the tightening of economic sanctions against Russia by Western states following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Financial sanctions included excluding certain Russian banks from the SWIFT system, prohibiting financing in Russia and the purchase of rubles, and banning the provision of wallet, account, or custody services for crypto-assets. Generally, transfers to Russia were prohibited, preventing exiled Russian citizens from sending money to their families. This also affected Ukrainians whose relatives remained in territories occupied by the Russian army, such as a Ukrainian woman in France unable to send a 100-euro bank transfer to her parents in Donetsk.\nIn the West, financial measures were also taken to enforce censorship of Kremlin-funded media. In January 2023, RT France, already banned from broadcasting in Europe but still accessible online, had its assets frozen, forcing it to close permanently.\nLastly, in discussing financial censorship instances, we must mention activities related to cryptocurrencies, which continue to face restrictions from financial institutions. Banks regularly impede cryptocurrency purchases by prohibiting clients (claiming to “protect” them) from sending funds to exchanges. Additionally, companies in the sector often struggle to open bank accounts due to traditional institutions’ mistrust7.\n7 In Cryptocurrency: The New War, François-Xavier Thoorens recounts how he and his family were expelled from their long-standing bank after attempting to open a professional account to receive funds from Ark’s ICO (pp. 91–97). His experience isn’t unique.Financial censorship is increasingly prevalent in our society. It affects many individuals across political spectrums, nationalities, and professions. Often enacted without specific legal decisions, it imparts a hidden, arbitrary nature to the exertion of real power, making it a subtle and challenging issue to articulate.\nThe intensification of this censorship drives people to explore Bitcoin. Experiencing such restrictions naturally leads individuals to seek ways to circumvent them, even if minor. When people grasp censorship as a concrete reality rather than an abstract risk, they feel compelled to liberate themselves and safeguard against this danger, highlighting (or reaffirming) Bitcoin’s value proposition8. This was the case for the author of this book, whose bank account was frozen without notice or explanation, only regaining access to his funds six months later.\n8 Nick Szabo described this effect on Peter McCormack’s podcast in 2019: “Some people need to be hit by reality. When you’re censored by a bank—which happens increasingly—and people start realizing they can silence political enemies through banks, they become Bitcoin fans.” — What Bitcoin Did Podcast, Nick Szabo on Cypherpunks, Money and Bitcoin, November 1, 2019: https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/nick-szabo-on-cypherpunks-money-and-bitcoin.",

    "section": "Censorship and Central Bank Digital Currency",
    "text": "Censorship and Central Bank Digital Currency\nThe trend is clear: with the widespread use of bank accounts over cash, the power of financial censorship has grown significantly. While this censorship remains occasional today, we can anticipate it becoming a more pressing issue in the future, especially with the gradual deployment of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the concurrent decline of physical cash.\nAs discussed in the section on central bank digital currencies in Chapter 4, digitizing money is the next step in state-issued currency evolution. Since 2016, central banks worldwide have been designing systems usable by the general public, with communications on the subject increasing since 2020.\nSuch digital currencies would allow for additional seigniorage income by eliminating cash production costs and reclaiming monetary activities currently facilitated through credit issued by commercial banks. More pertinent here, they would enable total financial control over citizens’ transactions by centralizing system management within the central bank and accredited organizations.\nThis control would naturally come with enhanced financial surveillance, justified by familiar pretexts like combating money laundering and terrorism financing. This could lead to a panoptic system where surveillance occurs without the subject’s awareness. Central banks deny intentions to move in this direction, but they will never make their systems entirely confidential, always reserving oversight rights for competent authorities.\nFinancial surveillance could be reinforced by the gradual disappearance of cash, already underway in some parts of the world. In Sweden, discussions about ending cash are active, with the state promoting innovative digital payment methods. In China, most transactions occur through mobile payment systems like WeChat Pay and Alipay. It’s no coincidence that these two countries were among the first to seriously consider developing a digital currency.\nThe war on cash manifests in some countries through demonetizing certain circulating bills, which can be exchanged for other bills or deposited into bank accounts upon proof of fund origin. In November 2016, India’s government, led by Narendra Modi, demonetized 500 and 1,000 rupee notes (worth approximately $7.50 and $15), constituting 86% of currency in circulation, aiming to combat counterfeit banknotes, tax evasion, and the informal economy. In early 2023, Nigeria attempted a similar move by limiting withdrawals and demonetizing large denominations to control inflation, fight counterfeiting, and promote the electronic naira (eNaira) launched by the central bank in October 2021. Such demonetization isn’t new; post-World War II Europe saw similar actions to curb inflation and eliminate black-market profits, leading the character Le Dabe in The Counterfeiters of Paris to remark, “When it comes to money, states have all the rights, and individuals none!”\nWith digital currency in place and cash significantly restricted, law-abiding citizens would have no choice but to use this surveilled system. The system could limit spending amounts, dictate usage purposes, and control trading partners. Moreover, being a computerized system, it could easily be programmed to impose spending conditions on users’ funds. Such programmability would allow authorities to steer individuals’ political, economic, and moral behaviors in desired directions, giving financial censorship unprecedented reach.\nEconomically, this could enhance what central bankers call monetary policy transmission—the process by which monetary policy decisions affect the broader economy and price levels. Currently, this transmission primarily operates through adjusting key interest rates. In the future, it could involve programming the currency itself, transforming social aid systems into direct subsidies requiring rapid spending in specific economic sectors to stimulate them.\nMorally, such programmability could massively influence people’s words and actions. In our modern society, this might occur under the guise of combating climate change by rewarding “eco-friendly” behaviors (like renting bikes) and penalizing “polluting” ones (like consuming meat). This suggests the potential establishment of a Chinese-style social credit system.\nPolitically, this system could suppress opposition by penalizing those with dissenting thoughts, outspoken critics, or protesters. Authorities could strengthen their position by enforcing measures not through public and legal avenues (aligned with the concept of the rule of law), but via covert and discretionary means. This could usher in the beginnings of a totalitarian regime where the state knows all, controls all, and formal laws become unnecessary. The CBDC would serve as a powerful tool for mass financial surveillance, potentially paving the way for an Orwellian future where individuals lack privacy and have minimal ability to resist authority.\nSuch widespread financial censorship would be unprecedented. Implementing it manually would be challenging, necessitating delegation to algorithms equipped with artificial intelligence to detect and instantly block undesired transactions. The CBDC system could lead us toward a scenario reminiscent of Saint John’s description in the Book of Revelation:\n“By these means, all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, will receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they cannot buy or sell unless they have the mark—the name of the beast or the number of its name”9.\n9 Revelation 13:16–17.In this dystopian world, whose ramifications we can scarcely imagine, hope would be embodied by Bitcoin, whose fundamental promise is to escape such interventions. Through its resistance to censorship, Bitcoin would serve as an oasis of freedom amid widespread servitude. Essentially, it would be the last refuge for a population ensnared by technological subjugation.",

    "section": "Censorship in Bitcoin",
    "text": "Censorship in Bitcoin\nTo understand how Bitcoin opposes censorship, we must examine how censorship can be applied to the blockchain. While the Nakamoto model is reputed to be resistant to censorship, this doesn’t mean it’s “uncensorable.” Censorship in Bitcoin is not only possible but also likely beyond a certain adoption stage.\nIn the context of Bitcoin, “censorship” specifically refers to the action of preventing a transaction from being executed on an economically irrational basis by hindering its permanent inclusion in the blockchain. This definition aligns with the idea of restricting an entity’s financial activity to shape its behavior. In a sense, this censorship resembles speech censorship, as it indirectly prevents an individual from recording a signed transaction in a ledger.\nCensorship in Bitcoin can be extrapolated from existing practices in the banking world and the cryptocurrency sector, beginning with the justifications used to defend it. On one hand, traditional finance’s reasons apply to Bitcoin: combating money laundering, terrorism financing, and protecting investors—since cryptocurrency can facilitate tax evasion, fund various projects, and partake in scams. On the other hand, new pretexts emerge, such as preventing local currency devaluation (a deflationary instrument poses unfair competition) or combating climate change (mining emits CO₂).\nAuthorities derive general regulations from these pretexts, applied internationally, as seen in the global banking system. Different jurisdictions base their policies on FATF recommendations, primarily aimed at fighting money laundering and terrorism financing. As discussed regarding jurisdictional arbitration (see Chapter 4), countries are strongly encouraged to implement these recommendations to avoid economic sanctions from member states. The IMF can also be leveraged, aiming to ensure global monetary system stability (thus protecting member states’ currencies).\nThis cooperation enables the creation of blacklists of addresses non-compliant with regulations, distributed to various regulated financial actors. Examples include lists compiled by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a U.S. Treasury agency enforcing international financial sanctions, which wields significant influence due to the extraterritoriality of U.S. law.\nCensorship already exists within parts of the Bitcoin economy. Regulated entities block bitcoins (and other cryptocurrencies) from blacklisted addresses and freeze user accounts until they provide explanations. However, this practice remains partial and implicit: transactions themselves aren’t explicitly prohibited yet, but funds must not be sent to regulated financial intermediaries like exchanges or payment processors. This situation pushes some platforms to overcompensate by rejecting bitcoins originating from coin mixers and freezing accounts of users engaging in such activities, even without explicit regulations10.\n10 On Ethereum, addresses linked to the Tornado Cash mixer contract were blacklisted by OFAC in August 2022. On BTC, no explicit laws or lists related to mixing exist—only general suspicion.Regulations can also extend to the mining industry. Mining naturally tends toward centralization through hash power aggregation in mining farms, miners joining pools, and pools using communication relays. These large entities are often identifiable and more likely to comply with transaction-processing regulations, potentially leading to network censorship.\nMiners might initially practice passive censorship by systematically refusing to confirm certain transactions for economically irrational reasons, typically under regulatory pressure. This type of censorship was considered by Marathon Group’s pool in 2021, which announced plans to practice “clean block mining”11 before retracting under public pressure. On Ethereum, this filtering occurs with validators using MEV-boost relays complying with OFAC standards, excluding transactions deemed illicit12. As of 2023, participants in these relays were primarily exchanges.\n11 Marathon Patent Group and DMG Blockchain Solutions announced plans for “clean block mining” in January 2021 before retracting under public pressure. — Archived press release: https://web.archive.org/web/20210128112455/https://www.marathonpg.com/news/press-releases/detail/1220/marathon-patent-group-and-dmg-blockchain-solutions-to-form.12 Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), initially called Miner Extractable Value, is the maximum value a validator can generate by reordering or excluding transactions in their block. As of October 2022, over 50% of Ethereum transactions passed through MEV-boost relays complying with OFAC standards. — See MEV Watch: https://www.mevwatch.info/.Passive censorship isn’t overly problematic since it requires 100% compliance by miners to be effective. Dissident miners—those deliberately ignoring regulations—can validate ignored transactions, mitigating the impact. Only confirmation times might be affected.\nThe situation becomes more severe if compliant miners (strictly adhering to regulations) start rejecting blocks containing “illicit” transactions. This active censorship involves preventing transactions from being confirmed by orphaning any blocks that include them. Sustaining this requires majority control of the network’s hash power—essentially a 51% attack. The weaker branches formed by the censorship attack are abandoned due to the longest-chain rule, as illustrated in Figure 9.1.\n\n\n\nActive Censorship Attack.\n\n\nSuch an attack’s cost can be colossal, depending on the hash power deployed13. However, this cost might be justified by the suppression of activities avoiding taxes and seigniorage. As discussed in Chapter 4, the typical attacker is the state, whose extraction power heavily relies on monetary control—it may not mind reducing (or destroying) Bitcoin’s utility to achieve its goals.\n13 As discussed in Chapter 8, such an attack costs billions on Bitcoin’s main network.This hypothetical attack would likely be preceded by a declaration of war against Bitcoin. Tolerance toward users would vanish, and unofficial activities would become official targets: all transactions not explicitly authorized would be declared illegal. Free usage would be criminalized, and honest mining would be targeted.\nSuch a crackdown would help co-opt more mining pools, transmitting state directives to them. The state could also requisition or purchase its own mining hardware, eventually amassing majority hash power. With sufficient power, the attack would commence.\nActive censorship is insidious because only 51% compliance is needed for enforcement. Prolonged over time, it could establish a new norm. Economically rational miners might be incentivized to comply with censorship, as Juraj Bednar discussed14. The attacker doesn’t necessarily need to maintain majority hash power indefinitely.\n14 Juraj Bednar, “Bitcoin censorship will most likely come, pt 2”, November 18, 2020: https://juraj.bednar.io/en/blog-en/2020/11/18/bitcoin-censorship-will-most-likely-come-pt-2/.15 Joshua A. Kroll, Ian C. Davey, Edward W. Felten, “The Economics of Bitcoin Mining, or Bitcoin in the Presence of Adversaries”, Workshop on the Economics of Information Security, 2013: https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten/writing/bitcoin-in-the-presence-of-adversaries.pdf.Privacy doesn’t prevent censorship but increases its cost. If all users refuse to comply with surveillance norms, censors would have to reject all transactions, forfeiting corresponding fees. The attack would effectively entail destroying the blockchain’s utility by mining empty blocks—a Goldfinger attack, named after the antagonist in the 1964 James Bond film who sought to irradiate the U.S. gold reserve at Fort Knox to render it unusable and inflate the value of his own gold15.\nThus, censorship in Bitcoin is possible. However, it’s neither easy nor definitive, thanks to a protocol mechanism designed to combat such attacks: resistance to censorship.",

    "section": "The Mechanism of Resistance to Censorship",
    "text": "The Mechanism of Resistance to Censorship\nResistance to censorship refers to the difficulty of arbitrarily obstructing transactions. It’s commonly cited as one of Bitcoin’s key promises: allowing anyone to send funds to anyone else, anytime, anywhere, provided they have Internet access.\nResistance to censorship is crucial for Bitcoin. Without it, the system couldn’t survive as it would become a centrally controlled platform, with an authority deciding which transactions are acceptable. It would need to adapt (like GoldMoney or PayPal) or perish (like e-gold or Liberty Reserve). Moreover, absolute control over transaction selection would allow such an authority to exert irresistible influence over the protocol through soft forks (as we’ll explore in Chapters 10 and 11), ultimately destroying the original monetary policy. Without resistance to censorship, Bitcoin’s value proposition collapses.\nHowever, Satoshi Nakamoto never explicitly described this resistance. In his communications, he explained how his system was economically secured against double-spending—a significant advancement over previous decentralized models—but didn’t elaborate on opposing censorship, i.e., partially or entirely blocking transactional activity by a hostile entity. He seemed to rely on the goodwill of “honest” miners, even suggesting there would “probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free”16, implying resistance was a given.\n16 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin v0.1 released, January 8, 2009, 19:27:40 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.html.17 Eric Voskuil initially described the censorship resistance mechanism in January 2018: https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/wiki/Other-Means-Principle/77d7556a14f89d1704f1bb97ca0aed04606363d0. See also Eric Voskuil, “Censorship Resistance Property,” in Cryptoéconomie: Fundamentals of Bitcoin, Amazon KDP, 2022, pp. 24–25.The mechanism of resistance to censorship was highlighted in 2018 by developer and author Eric Voskuil, who showed it fundamentally relies on transaction fees17. Similar to resistance against double-spending, resistance to censorship isn’t absolute but economic: regulation funded by fees from prohibited transactions.\nMining security hinges on a majority principle: the computing power controlled by honest miners must exceed that of attackers. The crucial factor isn’t the highest possible hash rate but that miners with significant power are willing to mine all transactions paying appropriate fees and consistently build on the longest chain.\nThus, security isn’t solely dependent on hash power. It also involves the distribution of that power and the proportion of miners relative to the broader population18. A hash rate concentrated in a single miner’s hands would offer security equivalent to a centralized system, dependent on that miner. Conversely, a widely distributed network with substantial hash power may face co-option risks if it comprises few miners compared to one with many.\n18 Eric Voskuil, “Qualitative Security Model,” in Cryptoéconomie: Fundamentals of Bitcoin, Amazon KDP, 2022, pp. 59–62.The solution to censorship lies with dissident miners willing to confirm contentious or illegal transactions. The risks these miners face must be economically compensated.\nDissident miners need anonymity to mine clandestinely. This is ensured as miners aren’t required to identify themselves within the protocol. Reporting mined blocks by pools is optional and voluntary, intended to reassure users about network distribution.\nThe portion of mining revenue from new coin creation plays a minor role in combating censorship, whether passive or active. This reward is identical for all miners, so it doesn’t influence their economic choice to include or exclude transactions. Furthermore, potential utility loss (and thus mining revenue) from active censorship (an attack) wouldn’t deter the authority aiming to achieve control or destruction by dictating permissible transactions.\nIn contrast, transaction fees are crucial to the resistance mechanism. Integrated into the protocol, these fees are publicly associated with each transaction. They counter passive censorship by incentivizing miners to confirm transactions and deter active censorship by enhancing the economic weight of the censored branch.\nIn an active censorship attack, censors obtain over half the network’s computing power and openly reject certain transactions (e.g., via a blacklist) by refusing blocks containing them. The censors’ chain is considered valid by honest nodes due to its length.\nHere, the fee mechanism plays a role. Users of censored transactions, noticing delays, increase their fees—a natural response observed during network congestion, like during the 2017 bubble when median transaction fees exceeded $30. It’s logical to pay higher fees to transfer large sums, which carry more risk than small transfers19.\n19 While Bitcoin fees are currently based on data size or transaction weight, heightened censorship threats might prompt users to pay fees proportional to transfer amounts, as in traditional finance.This increase generates additional fees—the difference between fees from all transactions and those from unauthorized transactions in honest nodes’ mempools. This surplus incentivizes dissident miners to deploy more hash power over time: the larger the suppressed economy, the greater the resulting hash power differential.\nDissident miners coordinate privately or signal to plan a response. Once sufficient hash power is gathered, they begin confirming censored transactions. With majority power, their chain becomes the longest, invalidating the censors’ chain. Thus, censorship is overcome—at least until the next attack.\nTherefore, the resistance mechanism is deeply embedded in the protocol. Proof of work, anonymous mining, and the integrated fee system collectively enable coordinating a fee market to repel censors. While we can’t guarantee Bitcoin’s uncensorability—given unknowns like the censored economy’s size, attack scale, or users’ willingness to pay fees—the mechanism remains functional.\nNotably, the role of transaction fees, elucidated by Eric Voskuil in 2018, has been overlooked by some crypto-economic protocols. Ethereum, for instance, opted to burn a portion of network fees to make ether deflationary with EIP-1559’s activation in August 2021. The Ethereum community also transitioned to proof of stake in September 2022, marking another step toward accepting censorship, as we’ll explain later.",

    "section": "The Importance of Privacy",
    "text": "The Importance of Privacy\nFinancial censorship closely aligns with transaction surveillance. Such surveillance refines transaction selection, allowing subtle control over the economy without alarming compliant individuals. This applies to both traditional banking and Bitcoin.\nProtecting one’s wealth and freedom can be approached in two ways: physical defense and concealment. Physical defense involves directly safeguarding property (possibly with firearms) or indirectly through state police or private security services—a common choice among the wealthy. While effective against common criminals, it’s less so against the dominant local power—the state.\nConsequently, individuals often opt for concealment, hiding their wealth to prevent others from seizing it directly. This deters aggressors relying on threats of violence, as extracting information incurs additional costs proportional to resistance.\nThis method ties directly to privacy—the act of restricting information to a select few. Privacy differs from secrecy in that one can choose to reveal information selectively. In financial contexts, this means ensuring transaction details are known only to participants.\nPrivacy underpins individual freedom in society and is essential for everyone. It creates an asymmetry between the weak and the strong, the individual and the state, preventing absolute encroachment on individual rights. States may argue otherwise, suggesting those with nothing to hide have nothing to fear20, but history—especially 20th-century totalitarian regimes—proves this false.\n20 “I say that anyone who trembles now is guilty; for innocence never fears public scrutiny.” — Maximilien de Robespierre, Speech of 11 Germinal, Year II, March 31, 1794.Thus, because financial censorship originates from state initiatives, resistance to censorship is intrinsically linked to privacy.\nOn one hand, individual resistance to censorship relies on system privacy. If the state knows all transactions, it can penalize users for unauthorized transactions, even if confirmed by the network. Some BTC proponents highlight protocol transparency as an advantage over opaque banking systems, emphasizing pseudonymity and reserving anonymity for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero. However, this misunderstands transparency’s role: in Bitcoin, data is public solely to ensure consensus and auditability; Monero simply implements a different transparency compromise.\nOn the other hand, user privacy depends on the system’s resistance to censorship. If the state controls transaction selection, it can choose to confirm only transactions revealing sender and recipient identities. Some Monero advocates argue that default system privacy protects users from censorship, as the state can’t censor unknown transactions. However, this view is naive, as users can technically disclose address-related information to surveillance authorities21; the main barrier is the additional cost such surveillance entails.\n21 In Monero and similar systems, disclosing transactions linked to an address involves using a private view key.Therefore, privacy and resistance to censorship are interdependent in Bitcoin. Without privacy, individual resistance to censorship falters; without resistance to censorship, individual privacy erodes. Consequently, widespread surveillance poses a significant threat.\nSurveillance has expanded in Bitcoin alongside its economic growth, through regulation of financial intermediaries. Cryptocurrency exchanges have been compelled to implement KYC and AML standards akin to traditional banking. This information gathering has fostered blockchain analytics firms like Chainalysis and CipherTrace, which cross-reference identification data with blockchain events to derive probable interpretations, providing results to clients like state agencies and financial institutions. The net tightens further with adaptations of the “Travel Rule” recommended by the FATF and enforced by entities like Switzerland’s FINMA, requiring intermediaries to verify withdrawal addresses22.\n22 The Travel Rule, originating from the U.S. FinCEN in 1996, requires financial institutions to transmit sender information during certain transfers. The FATF extended this to “virtual assets” in June 2019. In the crypto context, it could involve integrating Address Ownership Proof Protocol (AOPP) into wallets.This evolution poses a substantial threat to Bitcoin. In response, efforts to thwart surveillance have emerged, including privacy-enhancing techniques like coin mixing (CoinJoin) and methods integrated into Monero. We’ll delve into this in Chapter 12.\nIn summary, privacy is vital for preserving wealth and autonomy. True freedom demands protecting one’s private life. As the writer Florian aptly noted: “To live happily, live hidden”23.\n23 Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian, “The Cricket,” in Fables de Florian, 1793.",

    "section": "Human Interventions in Consensus",
    "text": "Human Interventions in Consensus\nThe possibility of censorship in Bitcoin often inspires a search for solutions, reflecting the engineer mindset common among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Many are drawn to alternatives to fee-based regulation: direct human intervention on the blockchain. This involves leveraging “social consensus,” or the protocol’s determination mechanism. Two ideas gaining traction are anti-censorship UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) and proof-of-work change UAHF (User Activated Hard Fork). However, we’ll argue that this temptation is dangerous.\nThe first idea is to reject censorship by invalidating the censors’ chain partially or entirely, violating the longest-chain principle. This can be achieved by rendering censors’ blocks invalid or enforcing the validity of an alternative chain via a temporary checkpoint. Such measures constitute a soft fork (a restriction of consensus rules) and require user activation at a specific timestamp or block height, hence a UASF. This approach causes a split, as it lacks majority hash power support in censorship scenarios.\nThe concept of invalidating censorship through social consensus was discussed by Vitalik Buterin in 2016 regarding proof of stake:\n“On medium to long time scales, humans are quite good at consensus. Even if an attacker had unlimited hash power and managed a 51% attack against a major blockchain, reversing even just the last month of history, convincing the community of the new chain’s legitimacy would be much harder. They’d need to compromise block explorers, trusted community members, major media outlets, and more—convincing the world their chain came first. These social considerations ultimately protect any blockchain in the long term, whether the community admits it or not (note that Bitcoin Core acknowledges the primacy of the social layer)”24.\n24 Vitalik Buterin, “A Proof of Stake Design Philosophy”, December 30, 2016: https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51.25 Only one block (662,687) from the attacker was invalidated, discarding 172 blocks and making the uncensored chain valid. — Nikita Zhavoronkov on Twitter, December 1, 2020: https://twitter.com/nikzh/status/1333893457920876550.This measure can be implemented through direct invalidation, but it’s feasible only if censors mark their blocks in some way. This was done by Bitcoin ABC on December 1, 2020, to counter an active censorship attack from a disgruntled miner following a split with Bitcoin Cash25.\nAlternatively, checkpoints can be incorporated into the protocol—blocks deemed valid by default. This mechanism was added to Bitcoin software in July 2010 to prevent deep reorganizations; some checkpoints remain in Bitcoin Core26. By enforcing a specific block, censors’ chains can be invalidated. Bitcoin SV employed this in August 2021 amid active censorship27.\n26 The latest checkpoint is block 295,000 mined on April 9, 2014. See the chainparams.cpp file in Bitcoin Core.27 BSV Association on Twitter, September 3, 2021: https://twitter.com/BitcoinAssn/status/1422668065024663554.While such interventions might offer temporary relief, they don’t provide robust censorship resistance. Relying on social agreement for consensus introduces instability. It opens the door for hostile entities to destabilize the system by sowing discord within the community (e.g., pressuring influencers), leading to splits that can’t be objectively resolved.\nDirect human intervention in transaction confirmation is thus ill-advised. Even if participants agree on the undesirability of an event, they often disagree on handling it, as seen in the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split. Humans can reach consensus long-term, as evidenced by convergence in languages, religions, currencies, etc. However, short-term consensus is unlikely, necessitating automated mechanisms like mining.\nAnother proposed measure, less subjective but more disruptive, is altering the proof-of-work function. This would halt an attack by rendering censors’ specialized hardware obsolete, inflicting financial loss. It’s a hard fork (incompatible consensus rule change) requiring user activation—a UAHF. This extreme option was supported by developers like Luke-Jr and Gregory Maxwell during the block size debate (2015–2016) and defended by Bitcoin ABC’s lead developer Amaury Séchet in November 2018, calling it a “nuclear option of last resort”28.\n28 Amaury Séchet (deadalnix) on Twitter, November 12, 2018: https://twitter.com/deadalnix/status/1061947426096009216.Like invalidating censorship through social intervention, this route is more harmful long-term than maintaining the status quo. Firstly, losses incurred by censors also affect honest and dissident miners. Secondly, the economy splits between two chains, reducing overall utility. Thirdly, attack costs decrease short-term. Fourthly, miners lose protocol confidence, necessitating risk hedging against future changes, raising security costs. Lastly, the new mining distribution may not improve over the old, as large miners can deploy capital more efficiently.\nOverall, short-term human intervention is undesirable. If the chain faces a mining attack, it’s likely under social attack too. Interventions may multiply, leading to spiraling splits and economic insignificance. The case of Bitcoin Cash illustrates this: due to biannual hard forks, it underwent two major splits post-separation from Bitcoin-BTC (in 2018 with BSV and in 2020 with XEC), collectively valued at less than 1% of BTC’s aggregate value. Such risks are magnified for a mature Bitcoin supporting a large, diverse economy.",

    "section": "Variants of Proof-of-Work Consensus",
    "text": "Variants of Proof-of-Work Consensus\nCensorship risks have inspired alternative consensus algorithms to Nakamoto’s. The most notable is proof of stake, discussed in the next section. Other alternatives modify the proof-of-work algorithm, with three main variants: merged mining, proof of space, and early finalization.\nThe first is merged mining—simultaneously mining multiple chains by reusing work from a parent chain to validate auxiliary chains.\nSatoshi Nakamoto described this in December 2010 regarding BitDNS (the precursor to Namecoin). He wrote:\n“I think it’s possible for BitDNS to be a completely separate network and have its own blockchain, yet share proof-of-work with Bitcoin. The only overlap would be miners able to search for proof-of-work for both networks simultaneously.\nNetworks wouldn’t need coordination. Miners would run both networks in parallel, hashing in such a way that solutions solve both. A solution might apply to only one network if difficulties differ.\nAn external miner could call ‘getwork’ on both programs and combine the work.\nRather than fragmenting effort, networks would share and increase total computational power. This solves the issue of multiple networks endangering each other if computational power concentrates on one. Instead, all networks share combined power, making it easier for smaller networks to launch by tapping into existing miners”29.\n29 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: BitDNS and Generalizing Bitcoin, December 9, 2010: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28696#msg28696.Merged mining reuses partial proof-of-work from a parent chain as valid for an auxiliary chain. These auxiliary proofs (AuxPoW) are mining byproducts requiring no additional energy—only management of the auxiliary chain.\nAuxiliary chain miners receive extra rewards from local coin creation (if using a new unit) and transaction fees, incentivizing parent chain miners to participate. This allows auxiliary chains to quickly gain significant hash rates.\nMerged mining facilitates bootstrapping new cryptocurrencies by leveraging established mining industries. It has been implemented with Namecoin (relative to Bitcoin) and Dogecoin (relative to Litecoin). It’s also suggested for sidechain synchronization, as in RSK’s hybrid implementation, and considered in Paul Sztorc’s Drivechain proposal (see Chapter 14).\nHowever, merged mining’s security benefits over classic mining are limited. While it increases participants and restricts attackers (to parent chain miners), attack costs remain tied to the auxiliary chain’s mining revenue and, in censorship cases, transaction fees.\nAn illustrative example is Coiledcoin (CLC), an alternative cryptocurrency launched in January 2012, which suffered a fatal censorship attack soon after. Bitcoin developer Luke-Jr executed the attack via his mining pool Eligius without informing miners. He noted that no pool members suffered losses—the main cost was his time configuring software30.\n30 Luke-Jr, Re: [DEAD] Coiledcoin - yet another cryptocurrency, but with OP_EVAL!, January 6, 2012: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=56675.msg678006#msg678006.Merged mining affects parent chain mining security by artificially increasing block mining power, seemingly beneficial but ineffective against transaction censorship. It also centralizes mining due to the burden of managing auxiliary chains: if they become economically significant, parent chain miners must mine them to remain profitable.\nThe second alternative is proof of space (or capacity/storage), based on memory storage rather than computing power—the resource is disk space.\nThis idea has partially appeared in hybrid proof-of-work algorithms to deter specialized hardware (ASICs) and favor general hardware (CPUs, GPUs). Examples include the scrypt function in Tenebrix (inherited by Litecoin), Ethereum’s former Ethash algorithm, and Monero’s RandomX.\nPure proof-of-space algorithms exist, such as Chia Network’s system by Bram Cohen, using “proofs of space and time” to determine the correct chain.\nThese algorithms aim to enhance censorship resistance by encouraging broader participation, improving validation distribution. However, they merely shift the problem. Proof of space still involves external energy expenditure, resembling proof of work. Optimization remains possible at hardware (ASICs) and industrial levels (economies of scale), so centralization pressures persist. The goal becomes aligning specialized hardware efficiency with universally used tools, as RandomX attempts with CPUs.\nThe third alternative is early block finalization—implementing moving checkpoints to consider blocks below a certain depth as final. Vitalik Buterin describes this as “weak subjectivity”31.\n31 Vitalik Buterin, “Proof of Stake: How I Learned to Love Weak Subjectivity”, November 25, 2014: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity.Bitcoin ABC introduced such an algorithm on November 20, 2018, in Bitcoin Cash, to counter threats from Bitcoin SV, considering blocks final after 11 confirmations. This persists in some Bitcoin Cash and XEC implementations and is enforced by major exchanges, making it a de facto consensus rule.\nEthereum Classic, after multiple double-spend attacks in 2019 and 2020, integrated a variant called Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring (MESS) on October 11, 2020. MESS assigns different scores to competing branches, favoring earlier-seen segments. It purportedly reduces attack costs by a factor of 31.\nWhile these algorithms reduce opportunistic attack risks by preventing reorganizations, they adversely affect censorship attacks aiming to destroy chain utility. They introduce subjectivity issues—a synchronizing node can be deceived by attackers presenting a longer chain, causing confusion32.\n32 This issue can be mitigated by socially declaring certain blocks valid by default, but this reintroduces earlier concerns.Ideally, Bitcoin includes no checkpoints beyond the predefined genesis block, with chain correctness determined solely by accumulated work. Despite implementing manual checkpoints himself, Satoshi Nakamoto stated:\n“The software has no way of automatically knowing if one chain is better than another except by the total proof-of-work. In the design, it needed to go with the longest chain, no matter how far back it had to go”33.\n33 On accepting the longest chain, Satoshi added: “The software has no way to know automatically if one chain is better than another except by the most proof-of-work. In the design, it needed to go with the longest chain no matter how far back it went.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: checkpointing the block chain, August 16, 2010: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=834.msg9816#msg9816.",

    "section": "Proof of Stake",
    "text": "Proof of Stake\nAn alternative to Nakamoto’s proof-of-work is another Sybil attack resistance mechanism: proof of stake. Proof of stake allows participants to demonstrate involvement through staking units in the system, impacting validator selection for block production. The likelihood of validating a block is often proportional to the staked amount.\nStaked units are locked and can be destroyed if validators act maliciously—a deterrent against the “nothing-at-stake problem,” where validators might validate multiple competing chains. For example, Ethereum’s Casper FFG implements “slashing” to penalize misbehaving validators34, protecting against short-range attacks. Checkpoints, separating “epochs,” counter long-range attacks due to proof-of-stake’s subjectivity.\n34 Vitalik Buterin et al., “Combining GHOST and Casper”, May 11, 2020: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03052.pdf.The concept dates back to Wei Dai’s 1998 b-money proposal (see Chapter 6), where servers deposited b-money to participate, serving as collateral.\nThe term “proof of stake” was coined in July 2011 by forum user QuantumMechanic, suggesting its adaptation for cryptocurrencies35. Sunny King and Scott Nadal implemented it in August 2012 with PPCoin (now Peercoin), using a hybrid model combining energy and coin age.\n35 QuantumMechanic, “Proof of stake instead of proof of work”, July 11, 2011: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=27787.msg349645#msg349645.Variations include delegated proof of stake (considering staked and delegated units) and other forms like proof of storage (Peercoin), proof of velocity (Reddcoin), and proof of importance (NEM).\nGenerally, Sybil resistance mechanisms in open systems can be external proofs (based on physical energy use) or internal proofs (based on ledger state). Proof of stake’s self-referential nature can pose issues.\nProponents argue proof of stake is more secure due to higher attack costs. A censorship attack could also devalue the unit, reducing the attacker’s capital. However, we argue proof of stake offers weaker censorship resistance.\nFirstly, accumulating necessary units isn’t insurmountable. Not all holders participate in consensus; attack thresholds often require only 34% of staked funds. Centralized entities offering staking services, subject to regulation and co-option, control large unit portions.\nSecondly, proof of stake allows better validator identification, linked to public keys and staked funds, whereas miners in proof of work can discretely redirect hash power.\nLastly, and most critically, proof of stake’s internal nature makes fighting censorship harder. Unlike proof of work, where additional energy can counteract censorship, proof of stake doesn’t allow creating new units without altering consensus rules. Censors controlling majority units remain untouchable.\nTo address this, Ethereum’s proof-of-stake advocates suggest relying on social consensus—not only manually selecting valid chains but rebalancing unit distributions to eliminate censorship. Creating new units raises allocation issues, so instead, censors’ staked funds could be destroyed—a “social slashing”36. Vitalik Buterin supports this, stating:\n36 Eric Wall, “The Case for Social Slashing”, August 22, 2022: https://ercwl.medium.com/the-case-for-social-slashing-59277ff4d9c7.37 Vitalik Buterin, “Why Proof of Stake (Nov 2020)”, November 6, 2020: https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html.“For harder-to-detect attacks (like a 51% coalition censoring others), the community can coordinate a minority user-activated soft fork (UASF) where the attacker’s funds are significantly destroyed (in Ethereum, via the ‘inactivity leak’ mechanism). No explicit ‘hard fork to delete coins’ is needed; except for coordinating the UASF to select a minority block, everything else is automated and follows protocol rules”37.\nAs of writing, this measure hasn’t been applied in Ethereum. The closest case was the dispute between Justin Sun’s Tron Foundation and the Steem community, leading to the community freezing the foundation’s funds in March 2020—a split between Steem and Hive resulted.\nWhile social consensus might seem appealing, it’s risky, potentially causing confusion and splits. Ultimately, this distinction reflects differing threat models between proof of stake and proof of work. Bitcoin’s security model is more stringent than Ethereum’s due to these considerations.",

Nakamoto’s genius lies in devising a consensus mechanism based on an external, objective quantity—allowing censorship resolution without human protocol intervention, even against state attacks.\nImplementing proof of work consumes significant electrical energy, anchoring the protocol in reality—a necessary price for true censorship resistance. Consumption can be reduced but not eliminated.\nEnergy consumption is a common critique against Bitcoin due to perceived environmental impact38. However, as discussed, opposing Bitcoin’s energy use might exacerbate conflicts between financial control and censorship resistance, increasing energy consumption on both sides. Promoting greater monetary and banking competition to reduce Bitcoin’s utility could more effectively reduce energy use.\n38 The first critique of Bitcoin’s energy use came from former cypherpunk John Gilmore in January 2009: “The last thing we need is a system designed to burn all available cycles, consuming electricity and generating CO₂ across the internet, to produce tiny amounts of digital dollars to pass emails or spam.” — John Gilmore, Proof of Work -&gt; atmospheric carbon, January 25, 2009: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015042.html.Proposals to abandon proof of work, like Greenpeace’s in 2022, fall into the category of social attacks on Bitcoin.

    "text": "The Protocol\nAt its core, Bitcoin is a computer communication protocol—a set of rules enabling different parts of a network to exchange information. This protocol allows nodes in the peer-to-peer network to share transactions and blocks and to agree on the correct ledger of ownership. The result is a monetary system.\nBitcoin closely resembles existing protocols, to varying degrees. For example, it is akin to other protocols built on the Internet, such as HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), used for displaying web pages; SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), used for email; or BitTorrent, which facilitates peer-to-peer file sharing. It also parallels the protocols underpinning the Internet itself, known as the TCP/IP suite, named after its first two components: IP (Internet Protocol), which handles communication at the network layer, and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which manages transmission at the transport layer, overlaying the network layer.\nMore distantly, programming languages can be considered protocols. These languages allow code (specific text encoded in UTF-8) to be written and then transformed into executable files by a compiler (as with C, C++, or Java) or directly executed by an interpreter (as with Python or JavaScript). Similarly, human languages like French or English are communication protocols with less formal and well-defined rules but enable people to exchange information.\nFinally, currencies can be viewed as types of protocols, serving as common means to communicate value and formalize economic exchange. A currency is particularly defined by the medium accepted in commerce: for a commodity like gold or silver, the medium is a chemical element; for fiat money, it is a certificate issued by an authority.\nIn Bitcoin’s case, the protocol comprises all the rules that enable the network to communicate and coordinate. This protocol is divided into two distinct parts: the transmission protocol, consisting of network rules, and the protocol governing the transmitted content, consisting of consensus rules.\nNetwork rules govern how nodes communicate over the Internet. These rules concern the underlying transport protocol (TCP, Tor, UDP for FIBRE), the network port (8333 for the main BTC network), peer discovery procedures, message syntax for data transmission, and so on. These rules can vary between nodes without formally breaking consensus; a node accepting both rule sets can act as a bridge. Similarly, nodes are free to restrict (temporarily or permanently) their connections with other nodes, particularly to prevent spam.\nConsensus rules govern the construction and organization of blocks and transactions. They regulate the validity of the ledger on which network members agree, hence their name. These rules are critical: a node transmitting an invalid transaction or block to other nodes will have its transaction or block rejected by the rest of the network.\nThe consensus rules are numerous. Some are widely known and explicit. Here are a few examples:\nThe consensus rules are too numerous to list exhaustively. When they are not explicitly stated, these rules are implicitly defined in the reference software implementation, which is Bitcoin Core in the case of BTC.",

The most well-known is Bitcoin Core, which is both the historical implementation created by Satoshi Nakamoto (the “Satoshi client”) and taken over by Gavin Andresen in 2010, the main implementation used by over 99% of nodes as of November 2023, and the reference implementation that defines implicit consensus rules.\nOther protocols have different implementations. Bitcoin Cash, for instance, has multiple implementations, with the two main ones being Bitcoin Cash Node (the reference implementation derived from Bitcoin ABC, itself derived from Bitcoin Core) and Bitcoin Unlimited. Ethereum also relies on a diversity of implementations that manage transaction transmission and verification (Geth, Nethermind, etc.) or block verification (Prysm, Lighthouse, etc.).\nAn implementation is generally free software, meaning its code is openly published under a license that allows use, modification, and reproduction. This technical and legal characteristic is essential to Bitcoin, as it not only allows verification of the software’s operation1 but also enables users to take control of the code if developers move in an undesired direction.\n1 “Open source code means that anyone can independently review the code. If it were closed source, nobody could verify the security. I think it’s essential for a program of this nature to be open source.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Questions about Bitcoin, 12/10/2009 20:49:02 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=13.msg46#msg46.Copying and modifying software is known as a fork. It involves creating new software from the source code of existing software, stemming from a different vision for the software’s development. Linux distributions are formed in this way from earlier distributions. Other examples include OpenOffice.org, which gave rise to LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice.\nBitcoin Core is directly descended from the first implementation coded by Satoshi Nakamoto and publicly shared on January 8, 2009. Initially called simply “Bitcoin,” the software was renamed bitcoind/Bitcoin-Qt in 2011 and then rebranded as Bitcoin Core on March 19, 2014.\nBitcoin Core is software written in C++. Initially hosted on SourceForge, the code is now available on GitHub2. It is released under the permissive MIT license, allowing anyone to copy and modify it at will. Specifically, the MIT license permits reuse of the code as part of or as a basis for software under a proprietary license. Satoshi chose this license over the GPL due to its compatibility with other licenses3.\n2 Bitcoin Core integration/staging tree: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.3 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Switch to GPL, 09/12/2010 19:24:53 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=989.msg12494#msg12494.The development of Bitcoin Core is open and meritocratic. The GitHub repository is open to all, and anyone can contribute to the maintenance and improvement of the software by submitting a pull request. Frequent contributors are known as “core developers.” To facilitate development, contributors communicate through various means, with the two main channels being the bitcoin-core-dev IRC channel, where most discussions take place, and the bitcoin-dev mailing list.\nHowever, Bitcoin Core does have a certain hierarchy. The repository is managed by maintainers responsible for merging code modifications proposed by contributors. Inclusion in the code depends on various criteria assessed by these maintainers, such as the demonstrable utility of the change, adherence to the project’s guidelines, peer review, or the contributor’s reputation4.\n4 “Maintainers will consider a patch if it aligns with the project’s overall principles, meets the minimum inclusion standards, and assess the general consensus of contributors.” — Contributing to Bitcoin Core, May 26, 2023: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/25.x/CONTRIBUTING.md.5 Wladimir J. van der Laan, The widening gyre, January 21, 2021, archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20210121201607/https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html; Wladimir J. van der Laan, Remove laanwj from trusted-keys (git commit), 02/07/2023 09:12 UTC: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/aafa5e945cef7a4f65ddadcf548932dd4e27ada1.Initially, the software was overseen by a lead maintainer who was responsible for appointing other maintainers, deciding the software’s release cycle, merging all modifications, and moderating debates. This role was first held by Satoshi Nakamoto, who managed the integration of contributions on the SourceForge repository. On February 23, 2011, Satoshi transferred responsibility to Gavin Andresen before disappearing for good. Gavin then led the project for over three years before passing the mantle to Wladimir J. van der Laan on April 7, 2014. On February 7, 2023, van der Laan stepped down after nine years of service. The lead maintainer position was subsequently abolished and replaced with collective responsibility among the maintainers5.\nAs of November 2023, there were five Bitcoin Core maintainers: Michael Ford, Hennadii Stepanov, Andrew Chow, Gloria Zhao, and Ryan Ofsky. They follow in the footsteps of notable former maintainers (excluding lead maintainers) such as Martti Malmi, Laszlo Hanyecz, Chris Moore, Pieter Wuille, Jeff Garzik, Nils Schneider, Gregory Maxwell, Jonas Schnelli, Samuel Dobson, and Marco Falke. Among active contributors who have never been maintainers are Matt Corallo, practicalswift, Luke-Jr, and John Newbery. The PGP fingerprints of the maintainers are publicly available in the repository.\nThis open approach gives the software greater security than most computer programs. Given the sums at stake, the reward for successfully exploiting a major vulnerability would be enormous, so one can assume that such a vulnerability has not been discovered. While vulnerabilities in the software may exist, they are very rare and subtle, typically discovered by well-intentioned developers—for example, developer Awemany responsibly disclosed an inflationary bug in the code in September 20186. Thus, the passage of time increases confidence in the software (and the system), in accordance with the Lindy effect7.\n6 Awemany, 600 Microseconds, September 21, 2018: https://medium.com/@awemany/600-microseconds-b70f87b0b2a6.7 As Hal Finney noted in 2011: “Each day that passes without Bitcoin collapsing due to legal or technical problems brings new information to the market.

    "text": "Bitcoin Improvement Proposals\nImplementations can be updated by their developers, each following their own decision-making model. In Bitcoin Core, as mentioned, anyone can propose code changes, but the final decision rests with the developers. Similarly, internal changes related to wallets are managed by their respective developers.\nHowever, there’s a way to propose changes that can apply to all implementations: Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), which are documents describing possible protocol changes or providing general information to the community. The BIP system was formalized by Amir Taaki in 2011, based on Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) used to improve the Python programming language. Initially defined by BIP-1, the procedure is now described by BIP-2, written by Luke-Jr. It is hosted on a GitHub repository managed by Bitcoin Core.\nBIPs can be categorized into three types: Standard Track BIPs, which concern changes affecting most or all Bitcoin implementations; Informational BIPs, which describe design issues or offer general guidelines or information to the Bitcoin community but do not propose new features; and Process BIPs, which describe or propose a process change. Standard Track BIPs are the most common and can pertain to various aspects: consensus rules, transmission protocol (Peer Services), software interfaces (API/RPC), or conventions used in applications8.\n8 Eric Lombrozo, BIP-123: BIP Classification, August 26, 2015: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0123.mediawiki.Before adoption, a BIP must undergo several stages. First, one or more authors are assigned to draft an initial version that adheres to the specified format and takes into account the current state of the art. The BIP is then shared with the Bitcoin developer community, usually via the development mailing list (bitcoin-dev). Discussions occur on this mailing list. Next, the BIP is officially proposed to the system as a pull request on the GitHub repository, which must be approved by the editor designated by Bitcoin Core (Luke-Jr since 2016). Finally, it is assigned a number and included in the repository as a draft. It can later change status over time, depending on community adoption, with the goal of becoming final or active.\n\n\n\nDiagram of the BIP adoption procedure, inspired by BIP-1.\n\n\nNote that these documents are used for BTC but also for other protocols. For example, BIPs describing wallet functionalities (BIP-32, BIP-39, BIP-44) are valid for the vast majority of cryptocurrencies. The SLIP-44 lists cryptocurrencies compatible with BIP-44. Other crypto-economic protocols sometimes have their own proposal systems. Ethereum uses EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals), Bitcoin Cash has CHIPs (Cash Improvement Proposals), Litecoin uses LIPs, and so on.",

    "section": "Verifying Consensus Rules",
    "text": "Verifying Consensus Rules\nBitcoin is based on a publicly accessible network of computers on the Internet. This network follows a peer-to-peer model, where all network members, called nodes, have equal privileges. These nodes ensure that the consensus rules are respected. If a block is invalid (containing an invalid transaction, for example), it is rejected by nodes enforcing the rules.\nIn Bitcoin, nodes maintain a copy of the transaction ledger (the blockchain) and, in doing so, ensure the validity of transactions and blocks. They communicate with other network nodes and relay new transactions and blocks, originating from users and miners, respectively.\nConsensus rule verification can be complete. In this case, the term “full nodes” emphasizes that they verify the entire chain. These nodes download the entire blockchain, check the consensus rules, and relay blocks and transactions. This is resource-intensive, both in terms of data storage (as of November 2023, the Bitcoin chain was approximately 530 GB, and the entire UTXO set over 8.5 GB) and bandwidth (the average size of blocks mined every 10 minutes was around 1.7 MB in November 2023).\nPruned nodes, which maintain the network state but not the entire chain, are full nodes because they have verified compliance with the rules over the entire chain. They simply cannot access the chain’s history before a certain date.\nVerification can also be partial, in which case we speak of light clients (or “light nodes” colloquially). This is useful for people who have no interest in running a full node—for example, in hashing software (implementing Stratum) and in lightweight wallets. They use a method conceptualized in the Bitcoin white paper in 2008: Simplified Payment Verification9.\n9 Satoshi Nakamoto described Simplified Payment Verification as follows: “It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he is convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it’s timestamped in. He can’t check the transaction himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) is a clever method that allows novice and occasional users to interact easily with the protocol without running a full node or blindly trusting a custodian. It significantly reduces the load on lightweight wallets.\nSPV relies on how transactions are chained and structured, as we saw in Chapter 8. First, the proof-of-work chain is not strictly a chain of blocks but a chain of headers. This means light clients only need to keep this chain of headers to determine the chain with the most accumulated work. Since each header is 80 bytes, the amount of data to store remains modest for modern devices: it increases by about 4 MB per year, totaling just over 62 MB in November 2023.\nSecond, transactions are arranged in a Merkle tree, allowing light clients to request only the branch information they’re interested in to verify the confirmation of one of their transactions. The number of hashes to obtain and compute depends on the binary logarithm (\\(\\log_{2}\\)) of the number of transactions in the block. For a block with 3,000 transactions (a high average on BTC), the load corresponds to requesting 12 hashes of 32 bytes and performing 12 hash computations for verification.\nThis simplified verification lightens the load on wallets but has major drawbacks. First, it lacks reliability: nodes cannot lie by inventing a transaction but can omit necessary information. This shortcoming can be partially mitigated by increasing the diversity of network connections. However, even then, verification remains vulnerable if the chain is attacked by an entity controlling the majority of computing power10.\n10 This case was described by Satoshi Nakamoto in the white paper: “As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker’s fabricated transactions as long as the attacker can overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user’s software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.11 One initial way to address the privacy issue was to implement Bloom filters, as described in BIP-37, but this method was ineffective. See Arthur Gervais, Srdjan Capkun, Ghassan O. Karame, Damian Gruber, “On the Privacy Provisions of Bloom Filters in Lightweight Bitcoin Clients”, in Proceedings of the 30th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, December 2014, pp. 326–335: https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/763.pdf. There’s also Neutrino, described in BIP-157 and BIP-158, which uses Golomb-Rice coding and requires more bandwidth.Second, SPV lacks privacy because the client must reveal some of its transactional activity through requests to network nodes. One way to partially address this is to increase the amount of information requested to mask essential details, but this method is far from perfect11.\nFinally, SPV inherently provides partial verification. Not all consensus rules are checked, meaning full nodes could agree on a rule change that goes unnoticed by the light client. For example, SPV clients do not verify constraints on block size, so the network could modify this limit without their awareness. This explains the strategy of SegWit2X proponents in 2017, who planned to double the block size limit without replay protection so that SPV wallets would simply follow the longest chain.\nSatoshi believed the system could persist with centralized verification by a few verifying nodes (including miners) and that other users would employ light clients. In his first response to James A. Donald in November 2008, he stated:\n“Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, users can use simplified payment verification (section 8) to check for double-spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes12.”\n12 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper, 11/03/2008, 01:37:43 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014815.html.In this, he was mistaken. Verifying consensus rules needs to be comprehensive for those rules to be enforced.\nThus, it is at the full node level that this verification occurs, a reality sometimes encapsulated by the adage “not your node, not your rules13.” Don’t trust, verify! Much like a language results from the choices made by its speakers, a computer protocol results from the rules enforced by full nodes. This verification plays a crucial role in determining the protocol.\n13 Understanding Bitcoin, Not Your Node Not Your Rules! w/ Ketominer, Udi Wertheimer, Francis Pouliot & Mir Liponi (video), April 5, 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwaKVIEm-rI.",

    "section": "Hard Forks",
    "text": "Hard Forks\nSince Bitcoin is open and free, the consensus rules can be modified at will by network nodes by changing the acceptance of blocks and transactions. These modifications can lead to network conflicts and potentially to a split into two separate networks, each managing its own chain and currency. This phenomenon is referred to as a fork.\nConsensus rule changes are commonly categorized into two types: hard forks, which are brute and incompatible upgrades, and soft forks, which have a degree of backward compatibility. Let’s explore how these changes manifest, starting with hard forks before describing soft forks.\nIn Bitcoin, the term fork is polysemous, bearing four different meanings: software fork, consensus rule fork, common chain fork, and persistent chain fork. This polysemy can cause confusion, so different terms are preferred for each meaning.\nFirst, fork is used in software development, particularly in free software that permits and encourages this practice. It refers to creating a program derived from the source code of an existing program and, by extension, the derivative program itself. In this sense, the reference implementation can undergo a fork, creating alternative software. This software may adhere to the consensus rules (like Bitcoin Knots) or deviate from them by creating a new protocol that shares the chain’s history (Bitcoin ABC, later Bitcoin Cash Node) or not (Litecoin).\nSecond, fork can denote the common branching of the blockchain, by analogy with software development. The blockchain is not a linear structure but a “tree-shaped structure14” that can have multiple branches of blocks, all compatible with the consensus rules accepted by the network, with the correct branch selected as the longest one (having the most accumulated work). This type of branching occurs regularly in Bitcoin quite normally and benignly when two miners simultaneously find different blocks, and it’s resolved when a new block is found.\n14 Satoshi Nakamoto, source code of Bitcoin version 0.1: https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/4184ab26345d19e87045ce7d9291e60e7d36e096/src/main.h#L1001-L1008.Third, fork can refer to a blockchain split caused by incompatibility of consensus rules. This is called a hard fork or “divergent fork.” This split is usually permanent in the sense that the two resulting branches cannot reconcile through Nakamoto’s consensus mechanism unless a very specific condition is met: if the majority branch’s rules form a restrictive subset of the minority branch’s rules. Ultimately, the two resulting chains are destined to exist on separate networks.\nFinally, fork can, by metonymy, denote a change in consensus rules, which can always cause a chain split and network separation. A restriction of consensus rules is called a soft fork, or “convergent fork,” due to its ability to result in a single branch. Any other modification of consensus rules, whether an extension or strictly incompatible change, is called a hard fork, referencing its propensity to create a chain split. These are the two modifications we’ll discuss here15.\n15 Note that the concepts are related. For example, a software fork (copy and modification) can implement a consensus rule fork (hard or soft fork) that ultimately creates a persistent chain fork (split).16 David François (davout), Re: Small protocol changes for flexibility, 12/07/2010 15:08:02 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=894.msg27757#msg27757.The hard fork is the older concept compared to the soft fork. It was previously termed an “incompatible change16.” A hard fork is a non-restrictive modification of the consensus rules. It causes a network conflict between nodes enforcing the old rules and those enforcing the new ones.\nA hard fork can be extensive, meaning it broadens the consensus rules on blocks and transactions. Old nodes can thus produce valid blocks on the new chain but not vice versa. A typical example of such a hard fork is increasing the block size limit, accepting larger blocks—2 MB instead of 1 MB, or 8 MWU instead of 4 MWU. This extensive hard fork is illustrated in Figure 10.1.\n\n\n\nDiagram of an extensive hard fork: If the chain following the new rule is longer than the one following the old rule, both chains persist; otherwise, only the second survives.\n\n\nIf the extensive hard fork is not supported by a majority of the network’s computing power, it may fail to create a persistent branch. For instance, blocks from the branch imposing a smaller size limit are entirely compatible with the new rules, so if it’s longer, it will be selected as the correct branch. To avoid this problematic situation, hard forks are generally bilateral.\nA bilateral hard fork is a hard fork that creates a total incompatibility between the new rules and the old ones. This can involve adding a rule requiring the first block of the fork to include an incompatible change. In our block size limit increase example, this would mean requiring the first block to be strictly larger than the previous limit, as shown in Figure 10.2. This additional rule is called wipeout protection.\n\n\n\nDiagram of a bilateral hard fork: The new rules are strictly incompatible with the old ones, so both chains persist.\n\n\nAnother example is changing the transaction signature algorithm, rendering all signed transactions and non-empty blocks strictly incompatible. This change can also provide replay protection if two competing chains persist.\nTwo scenarios can result from a hard fork: either the vast majority of the economy adopts the change, resulting in a single chain, or the economy fragments, and both chains persist. The first scenario is aimed for in a planned upgrade hard fork, which doesn’t intend to create two separate chains. The second arises from a contentious hard fork due to community division over the change. Accidental hard forks, caused by unintended modifications of implicit consensus rules, are excluded here17.\n17 On March 11, 2013, the migration from version 0.7 to version 0.8 of the software implemented a shift from the Berkeley DB database system to LevelDB. However, it turned out that Berkeley DB had a default lock limit not present in LevelDB. Consequently, the migration constituted an accidental hard fork, causing a split from block 225,430 that lasted about 6 hours. The decision was ultimately made to revert to version 0.7, invalidating the 24-block branch mined on version 0.8’s side, and to proceed with the migration months later. — See Vitalik Buterin, “Bitcoin Network Shaken by Blockchain Fork”, Bitcoin Magazine, March 13, 2013: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork-1363144448; and Gavin Andresen, BIP-50: March 2013 Chain Fork Post-Mortem: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki.A planned upgrade hard fork is a hard fork that requires synchronization of almost the entire community. It usually results in a single chain, effectively upgrading the protocol, though it’s essentially economic usage shifting from one protocol to another. It can be extensive, though bilaterality is preferred for security reasons.\nThe first known planned upgrade hard fork was likely the addition of OP_NOP operation codes to version 0.3.6 of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto in July 2010. Increasing block sizes was also considered a planned upgrade hard fork, notably by Satoshi himself18, until the contentious hard fork of Bitcoin Cash in 2017.\n18 In October 2010, following Jeff Garzik’s proposal to increase the limit directly to 7.168 MB to “match PayPal’s average transaction rate,” Satoshi—well aware this was a “network-incompatible” fix—wrote: “[The upgrade] can be introduced slowly, for instance: if (blocknumber &gt; 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit. It can start being introduced into versions long before then, so by the time it reaches the block number and takes effect, old versions that don’t have it are already obsolete. When we get close to the limit block number, I can send out an alert to old versions so they know they need to upgrade.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: [PATCH] increase block size limit, 10/04/2010 19:48:40 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366.Outside of BTC, upgrades via hard fork are numerous, often due to a smaller and/or more centralized economy. Examples include Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Ethereum Classic, and Ethereum, where such upgrades occur regularly.\nA contentious hard fork aims deliberately to create a new chain, stemming from a community disagreement so strong it leads to secession. It’s usually bilateral.\nThe first major example of a contentious hard fork was on Ethereum in July 2016, following TheDAO hack. This hard fork sought to recover the hacker’s funds through an “irregular state change.” It was made bilateral by a rule requiring the first 10 blocks post-activation to include the string dao-hard-fork. Since the economic majority supported the reversal, the altered chain retained the Ethereum name and ETH ticker, while the other chain became Ethereum Classic with the ETC ticker.\nThe second example is the hard fork that led to Bitcoin Cash’s creation in August 2017, following the scalability debate and the block size war. This hard fork did not include SegWit, increased the block size limit to 8 MB, and improved the signature algorithm. It was made bilateral by a rule requiring the activation block to be strictly larger than 1 MB. It also effectively provided replay protection. Since this change happened without the economic majority’s agreement, the chain that didn’t modify the rules kept the Bitcoin name and BTC ticker, while the new chain adopted the name Bitcoin Cash and the BCH ticker.\n\n\n\nExamples of bilateral hard forks: ETH/ETC and BCH/BTC.\n\n\nNote that such a hard fork may involve modifying the difficulty adjustment algorithm. If the computing power is too low to support it, the adjustment might not occur in time. For this reason, Bitcoin Cash implemented an Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA) to adjust more quickly. Ethereum Classic didn’t need this, as Ethereum’s adjustment already occurred at every block.",

    "section": "Soft Forks",
    "text": "Soft Forks\nLet’s now discuss soft forks, a method of upgrade often misunderstood. A soft fork is a restriction of the consensus rules. By essence, it reduces the set of valid blocks and transactions by adding a rule or modifying an existing one to be more restrictive. A typical example is reducing the block size limit. The explicit addition of the 1 MB limit in October 2010 was, therefore, a soft fork.\nA soft fork can be applied while maintaining a single chain. If enforced by the majority of the network’s computing power, there’s no risk of a split. Blocks created by miners following the new rules are entirely compatible with the old rules, so if the new rule chain is longer, it will be considered the correct branch by all nodes. If the soft fork is enforced by a minority, it results in two persistent chains. Both scenarios are illustrated in Figure 10.4.\n\n\n\nDiagram of a soft fork: If the chain following the new rule is longer than the one following the old rule, only the first survives; otherwise, both chains persist.\n\n\nThe concept of a soft fork emerged after that of a hard fork. It was formally discovered by Gavin Andresen in October 2011, who, following his study of Nicolas van Saberhagen’s proposal to add the OP_EVAL operation code19, realized that the upgrade could be done using the OP_NOP1 operation code without necessarily causing a split20.\n19 Nicolas van Saberhagen (ByteCoin), OP_EVAL proposal, 10/02/2011 00:49:19 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=46538.msg553689#msg553689.20 “I’m probably reading the code wrong, but I think OP_EVAL wouldn’t cause a blockchain fork!” Gavin Andresen expressed on IRC. — #bitcoin-dev IRC logs, October 2, 2010, archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20131201200245/http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2011/10/02.21 Satoshi Nakamoto, reverted makefile.unix wx-config – version 0.3.6 (git commit), 07/29/2010 18:27:12 UTC: https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/119/.The OP_NOP operation codes are Bitcoin script instructions added by Satoshi in July 2010 with the mere comment “expansion21.” The change became effective with version 0.3.6 of the software, which also fixed the 1 RETURN bug and was released on July 29. Their initial role is silent: if they appear in a script, they do nothing but do not invalidate the transaction. The direct consequence is that the behavior of these operation codes can be modified without rendering scripts incompatible with old consensus rules. The addition of this feature indicates that Satoshi had grasped the soft fork mechanism.\nA soft fork has a “backward-compatible” nature—or more accurately, it’s upward compatible, as compatibility is ascending, not descending—in that old software versions can continue interacting with the system. Non-mining nodes following old rules continue to see blocks produced as valid. This characteristic is a major advantage over hard forks.\nHowever, this upward compatibility doesn’t mean a soft fork is “soft.” It has a pernicious side in that it makes the modification hard to grasp. Soft forks have several drawbacks.\nFirst, they are not optional. If enforced by the majority of computing power, a soft fork effectively resembles a censorship attack on users following old rules. Thus, a soft fork has a coercive aspect that a hard fork lacks.\nSecond, a soft fork is challenging to reverse. Newly added functionalities cannot be simply deactivated; once adopted, there’s no easy rollback. Bitcoin SV developers, for instance, deactivated P2SH in February 2020, exposing less attentive users to theft.\nThird, a soft fork is not limited in scope. It can increase the effective block size limit (via an auxiliary block, also called an extension block or generalized soft fork). This extension block can also include additional functionalities (like MimbleWimble in Litecoin). It can even alter the protocol’s monetary policy by redefining the base unit22.\n22 How a soft fork can introduce inflation into Bitcoin was explained by developer Peter Todd in 2016. — Peter Todd, Forced Soft Forks, January 18, 2016: https://petertodd.org/2016/forced-soft-forks.Finally, a deep soft fork adds complexity due to the constraints of its application. It introduces new exceptions to consensus rules, generating technical debt for developers.\nThe archetype of a deep and complex soft fork was the SegWit upgrade, or Segregated Witness, which involved moving transaction signature data (called witness data) to a separate data structure to eliminate transaction malleability. This upgrade, which occurred on August 24, 2017, was initially supposed to be a hard fork until developer Luke-Jr described in 2015 how to make it a soft fork. Backward compatibility was ensured by linking the witness to the block via a Merkle tree root placed in the coinbase transaction and by using anyone-can-spend transaction outputs. Besides fixing the malleability issue, it introduced a versioning system (allowing the later integration of Schnorr-Taproot) and moderately increased the network’s transaction capacity, enabling effective block sizes to exceed 1 MB, up to 4 MB theoretically. It also added four new address types to the protocol.\nMoreover, a soft fork requires the majority of the network’s computing power to preserve its significance. If not followed by 51% of computing power in the medium term, its application results in a split. This explains why miner activation is generally preferred over user activation, even though the decision-making power ultimately lies with the users, as we’ll see in Chapter 11.\nOn one hand, a User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) involves implementing the soft fork in the software code to take effect at a specific block height or timestamp. This method relies on the belief that the economy applying the upgrade will be significantly majoritarian and that mining activity will follow in the medium term due to higher block rewards.\nOn the other hand, a Miner Activated Soft Fork (MASF) makes activation dependent on miners signaling support within validated blocks. It activates when a certain signaling threshold (e.g., 95%) is exceeded. This method, whose procedure was described in BIP-9, ensures as much as possible that miners apply the upgrade and that only one chain remains.\nThe same distinction exists in hard fork activation, but it holds little relevance since computing power cannot prevent a split. Therefore, Miner Activated Hard Forks (MAHF), long supported by proponents of increasing the block size limit, have no particular advantage.\nLike hard forks, soft forks can be categorized into two somewhat distinct types: planned upgrade soft forks and contentious soft forks. A soft fork is ideal for upgrading the protocol, allowing nodes to update gradually. Although it requires some synchronization, it’s not as demanding as hard forks.\nIn BTC, soft forks have been favored by developers since their discovery. Many upgrades have been soft forks, such as Pay to Script Hash (BIP-16), the requirement to specify the block height in the coinbase transaction (BIP-34), and the addition of a signature encoding standard (BIP-66). The additions of OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY operation codes, allowing time locks in the script language using OP_NOP2 and OP_NOP3, were also soft forks. More recently, the adoption of Schnorr-Taproot (or simply Taproot) was a soft fork upgrade.\nLitecoin also uses this type of transition. The protocol notably integrated SegWit in May 2017 and Schnorr-Taproot and MimbleWimble (MWEB) in May 2022.\nA contentious soft fork aims to force a minority of the community to follow the majority. If successful, there’s only one chain; dissenters have the choice to accept the rules or undertake a minority hard fork. If it fails, two competing chains result.\nSegWit is the typical example of a successful contentious soft fork. It wasn’t approved by all major actors (both large block proponents and protocol purists like Mircea Popescu23 opposed it), but it garnered majority support, allowing it to persist and forcing dissatisfied “big blockers” to migrate to Bitcoin Cash.\n23 Mircea Popescu, There’s a one Bitcoin reward for the death of Pieter Wuille. Details below., December 10, 2015: http://trilema.com/2015/theres-a-one-bitcoin-reward-for-the-death-of-pieter-wuille-details-below/.24 Amaury Séchet, Bitcoin ABC’s plan for the November 2020 upgrade, August 6, 2020: https://amaurysechet.medium.com/bitcoin-abcs-plan-for-the-november-2020-upgrade-65fb84c4348f.An example of a failed contentious soft fork is Bitcoin ABC’s team’s attempt to redirect 8% of Bitcoin Cash’s mining subsidy for their own benefit on November 15, 202024. This attempt, a soft fork due to its restrictive nature, led to a split between a majority branch without redirection (BCH) and a minority branch with it, later renamed “eCash” (XEC).\nThus, whether unanimously approved or only by a majority, soft forks are superior to hard forks. Despite being sometimes more complex, they don’t require synchronization of the entire economy, allowing gradual adaptation—a significant benefit for an open system used by a diverse group like Bitcoin. Supermajority miner signaling minimizes the risk of splits and preserves network effects as much as possible.\nHowever, this major advantage comes at a cost: the clarity of consent. In a hard fork, consent is clear—those who want the change are on the chain they’ve chosen. In a soft fork, consent is more ambiguous—the act of operating on the chain doesn’t necessarily indicate active acceptance of the change but perhaps passive resignation and a refusal to undertake a minority hard fork. As Vitalik Buterin aptly wrote in March 2017:\n“Soft forks clearly favor coercion over secession systemically, whereas hard forks have the opposite tendency25.”\n25 Vitalik Buterin, Hard Forks, Soft Forks, Defaults and Coercion, March 14, 2017: https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/14/forks_and_markets.html.Therefore, even though they are generally superior, soft forks aren’t suitable for all situations.",

    "text": "Resistance to Inflation\nOne of Bitcoin’s two major promises is to resist monetary inflation—that is, to make it difficult to create additional units beyond what the market accepts. This promise is substantial: as we saw in Chapter 4, the state does everything in its power to benefit from monetary creation, a phenomenon known as seigniorage. At first glance, it seems surprising that a digital entity could possess such a property.\nBitcoin’s original monetary policy was established by Satoshi Nakamoto when the prototype was launched on January 8, 2009. This policy was straightforward: monetary creation would be halved every four years, becoming negligible over time. The plan was to create 10.5 million units linearly over the first four years, 5.25 million over the next four, 2.625 million over the following four, and so on, limiting the total number of units in circulation to 21 million. Bitcoin was envisioned to become a currency with a fixed supply—something unprecedented in history.\nThis monetary policy became one of Bitcoin’s selling points, leading some to believe it was immutable and carved in stone, with the mathematical application of Satoshi Nakamoto’s decree guaranteeing the system’s resistance to inflation. For instance, Tyler Winklevoss, who invested in bitcoin with his twin brother Cameron, was convinced in 2013 that he had purchased an asset free from human intervention:\n“We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error1.”\nHowever, this belief is, at best, a misguided approximation. It’s not sufficient for a rule to have been decreed in the past for it to manifest in present reality; it also requires acceptance and application by others. This acceptance is inherently subject to politics and human error.\nConfusion exists regarding bitcoin’s fixed monetary policy. Notably, Satoshi Nakamoto never specified how it could be safeguarded. Various theories have been proposed, ranging from miner intervention to the need for community unanimity, or even attributing legal authority to Satoshi’s decree. In all cases, the discussion revolves around “governance2” or “social consensus3”—that is, how Bitcoin’s rules are decided. This is the issue we refer to as determining the protocol.",

    "section": "The Influence of Merchants on the Protocol",
    "text": "The Influence of Merchants on the Protocol\nAs we’ve suggested, the protocol is determined by economic forces. Since Bitcoin is an economic system, it’s natural that its governing rules emerge from the market rather than from a fixed past decree or a current central authority.\nThe notion that the economy shapes the rules isn’t new. As early as spring 2012, Meni Rosenfeld wrote on Stack Overflow that changing the protocol required “an economic majority, i.e., adoption by the users and businesses that give the currency value4.” Gavin Andresen echoed this idea in May 2015 when discussing increasing the block size limit:\n4 Meni Rosenfeld, Re: How could the bitcoin protocol be changed? Has this ever occurred?, June 14, 2012, 13:53:19 UTC: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3945/how-could-the-bitcoin-protocol-be-changed-has-this-ever-occurred#comment4983_3948.5 Gavin Andresen, [Bitcoin-development] Proposed alternatives to the 20MB step function, May 29, 2015, 12:39:30 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/008340.html.“If we can’t reach consensus here, the ultimate authority for determining consensus is the code used by the majority of merchants, exchanges, and miners5.”\nHowever, the clarity of this concept only emerged after the events of the blocksize war, during which the underlying mechanisms became apparent. It wasn’t developers or miners deciding the rules but rather the users, and more precisely, the merchants. Eric Voskuil wrote in November 2018:\n“Bitcoin does not rely on a custodian, but for the sake of establishing a general principle, one can consider the set of all merchants as the collective custodian of Bitcoin6.”\n6 Eric Voskuil, “Custodial Risk Principle,” in Cryptoeconomics: Fundamental Principles of Bitcoin, Amazon KDP, 2022, pp. 34–35.7 This was recognized in January 2010 by NewLibertyStandard, Bitcoin’s first merchant, who stated: “Everyone who buys or sells goods using bitcoins, including exchangers, advances the Bitcoin economy.”—NewLibertyStandard, Re: New Exchange Service: “BTC 2 PSC”, January 19, 2010, 08:06:15 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=15.msg111#msg111.Merchants, broadly defined, are those who provide goods, services, or other currencies in exchange for bitcoin at market-acceptable prices. This activity is evident through actual transactions with customers and can be measured by the revenue received. In this way, merchants contribute to bitcoin’s utility, gauged by the quantity of goods and services it facilitates acquiring, and thus to the economic significance of the chain7. By operating nodes that verify consensus rules, they participate in determining the protocol in proportion to their potential economic activity.\nReferring to a single, changeable protocol is inaccurate: as sets of rules, protocols are each fixed, but their use and utility vary. Modifying the protocol involves creating a new protocol whose resulting chain becomes economically more significant than any competing branches, including the one adhering to the original protocol8. For example, SegWit was a contentious soft fork, but the resulting protocol was far more valued than competing protocols (BTC pre-SegWit and Bitcoin Cash), so we can say the BTC protocol was upgraded through this modification.\n8 Jeff Garzik aptly noted in October 2010 that “the effort to increase the transaction rate limit [was] the same as changing the fundamental nature of bitcoins: convincing the vast majority to upgrade.”—Jeff Garzik, Re: [PATCH] increase block size limit, October 4, 2010, 18:33:55 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15342#msg15342.Bitcoin, as a concept, naturally encompasses multiple protocols due to its open and free nature. There’s not just one Bitcoin protocol but several, much like there are multiple Linux distributions or various forms of the dollar. These protocols compete to gain utility through merchant adoption.\nWhat truly matters is the economic weight of the chains these protocols create. Anyone can define Bitcoin as they wish, perhaps declaring there’s only one protocol that cannot be altered without unanimity, but this stance doesn’t change the economic realities. If a modified chain captures 80% of economic activity, the chain following the original protocol rules would continue to exist but would be significantly downgraded and lose relevance. As Arthur Breitman noted in 2014, “the option of sticking with the original protocol is not at all relevant if the value of its tokens is annihilated by a change in consensus9.”\n9 Arthur Breitman, Tezos: A Self-Amending Crypto-Ledger, August 3, 2014: https://tezos.com/position-paper.pdf.This explains the practices that have naturally evolved within the ecosystem. We typically refer to Bitcoin as the main and economically dominant implementation of the concept. In cases of a split, the name and market ticker of the original protocol are usually retained by the majority branch, whether it keeps the initial rules (Bitcoin-BTC) or modifies them (Ethereum-ETH). The minority branch must then adjust its name, either by extending it to emphasize continuity (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Ethereum Classic) or by adopting a new brand (e.g., “eCash” /XEC).\nThis economic mechanism means resistance to change comes from merchants who refuse to adopt new rules. Therefore, a modification that would undermine Bitcoin’s fundamental properties—such as introducing censorship or inflation—would only take effect if merchants accepted it. Merchants benefit from these fundamental properties through the freedom offered by the absence of censorship (facilitating, for example, tax evasion) and the increasing purchasing power of the funds received, incentivizing them to reject such changes. Specifically, bitcoin’s “natural deflation10” serves as the economic incentive maintaining its unique monetary policy.\n10 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: A few suggestions, December 13, 2009, 16:51:25 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=12.msg62#msg62.11 Eric Voskuil, “Qualitative Security Model,” in Cryptoeconomics: Fundamental Principles of Bitcoin, Amazon KDP, 2022, pp. 59–62.Similar to mining security, the commercial security of a chain—that is, the difficulty of altering its fundamental properties—doesn’t depend solely on its economic activity (revenues). It also hinges on the distribution of this activity and the number of merchants relative to the global population11. If economic activity is concentrated in the hands of a single actor, modifying the protocol becomes easy. Likewise, if high economic activity is evenly distributed among a small number of merchants, the protocol is more susceptible to change than if a large number of merchants are involved.\nJust as miners may delegate their transaction selection power (“hashers”), merchants can delegate their power to verify consensus rules. Merchants relinquish this power to custodial services, paying a commission to reduce usage complexity (such as node deployment) and transaction costs (through fee discounts). These custodial services might include wallet providers (Electrum, Acinq, Edge, Ledger, Trezor), payment processors (BitPay, Coinbase Commerce), or even block explorers (Blockchair, Mempool.space).\nDelegating verification poses an obvious centralization issue. While the economy can adapt and return to health in the medium term through new node deployments, the immediate commercial security of the chain suffers. An attack aiming to modify or eliminate the protocol can inflict significant short-term damage.\nThis impact intensifies if delegation involves asset custody with a third party, effectively making the custodian the real merchant with full control over the funds. This scenario is common with online exchanges that buy and sell other currencies using bitcoin while maintaining internal order books to balance supply and demand.\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin’s situation is unique because economic activity is dominated by exchanges between bitcoin and official currencies. Even during Satoshi’s time, exchangers were Bitcoin’s first merchants: the inaugural purchase using bitcoin wasn’t a pizza, as often recounted, but $5.02 via PayPal12. Today, centralized exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, and Binance have taken the lead, resulting in an economy that’s highly centralized and vulnerable to attacks.\n12 On October 12, 2009, the first merchant, NewLibertyStandard, “sold” $5.02 for 5,050 BTC to Martti Malmi, the first customer. One could argue that the miner of block 2,817, who received 2 BTC in transaction fees on February 3, 2009, was technically the first merchant for his service, but the amount was negligible.As with censorship attacks, efforts to alter Bitcoin’s fundamental properties are unlikely to originate from rational economic actors, who have no incentive to do so, but rather from political agents acting on behalf of the state. Such an attack would align with state objectives like combating money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT) or curbing speculation against the national currency. Highly regulated exchanges would be the primary targets.\nThus, merchants determine the protocol by choosing consensus rules that suit them, which they consistently verify using their nodes. A merchant’s individual power is weighted by their potential economic offerings, estimated by actual economic activity. However, this power isn’t linear, as it significantly depends on the network effect.",

    "section": "The Network Effect",
    "text": "The Network Effect\nA merchant’s direct power isn’t solely individual. Since Bitcoin is a currency, it’s subject to economic phenomena, the most significant being the network effect. This effect explains why there are fewer viable Bitcoin implementations than one might expect for a typical physical product.\nThe network effect refers to the phenomenon where the actual utility of a technology or product increases with the number of its users. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle—a virtuous circle: the more users a system has, the more it attracts new users.\nCurrency functions as a social network and is thus subject to the network effect. The overall utility of the network doesn’t grow linearly with its economic size but super-linearly. This concept is expressed by Metcalfe’s Law, which states that “the utility of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users13.”\n13 Metcalfe’s Law is named after Robert Metcalfe, co-creator of the Ethernet protocol and founder of 3Com, who observed this effect in 1980 regarding compatible communication devices. The law was formally stated by George Gilder in 1993 in an article in Forbes, suggesting network utility scales as \\(n^2\\) with \\(n\\) users, which overestimated the actual network effect. In 2006, Odlyzko’s Law proposed a more conservative utility scaling of \\(n \\log n\\).—George Gilder, Metcalf’s Law and Legacy, September 1, 1993: https://www.discovery.org/a/41/; Bob Briscoe, Andrew Odlyzko, Benjamin Tilly, Metcalfe’s Law is Wrong, July 1, 2006: https://spectrum.ieee.org/metcalfes-law-is-wrong.During the rise of the internet, the demand for a common protocol led TCP/IP to prevail over the competing OSI model of the time. Similarly, only a limited number of languages tend to dominate due to communication constraints. In international trade and diplomacy, there’s generally only one lingua franca within a given region. Historically, this has included Aramaic and Koine Greek in the Near East during Antiquity, Italian in Europe at the start of the Renaissance, French as the diplomatic language in the 18th and 19th centuries, and today, English globally.\nFor currencies, the network effect arises from individuals’ preference for a single currency. This is internally driven by the mental cost of economic calculations involving multiple currencies and externally by the exchange costs incurred when converting one currency to another. Consequently, people tend to favor using the most popular currency, even if it has flaws. Additionally, a currency used by a small group must offer significant advantages over others to endure. Over time, currencies tend to consolidate into a single dominant form, though barriers to complete unification may persist.\nIn Bitcoin, the monetary network effect is predominant. While it’s not the only network effect, it’s the one that drives others—such as liquidity, software development, economic security, and marketing communication—to manifest14.\n14 Vitalik Buterin, On Bitcoin Maximalism, and Currency and Platform Network Effects, November 19, 2014: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/20/bitcoin-maximalism-currency-platform-network-effects.15 A Schelling point, in game theory, is a solution that players in a coordination game tend to adopt in the absence of communication, because it seems natural or prominent.—Thomas C. Schelling, The Strategy of Conflict, Harvard University Press, 1960.Therefore, the network effect plays a crucial role in determining the protocol. The existence of a limited number of viable Bitcoin implementations and their stability results from this effect. This is why an economic supermajority is often sought before implementing protocol changes. It also encourages the ossification of the protocol in response to numerous change proposals. A natural Schelling point opposes altering consensus rules15: in the absence of a clear intent to modify the rules or in case of dispute, the default option is to do nothing.\nThe network effect explains the tendency toward maximalism within communities associated with specific protocols and units of account. Since there should logically be only one Bitcoin, any attempt to alter the concept is seen as futile and counterproductive, if not fraudulent. However, maximalism overlooks the substitution effect.",

    "section": "The Substitution Effect",
    "text": "The Substitution Effect\nThe second key economic influence on merchants’ individual power is the substitution effect. This effect directly opposes the network effect and leads to a greater number of Bitcoin implementations than one might expect if the concept weren’t naturally constrained.\nIn economics, a substitute product is a good or service that can be used for the same purpose as another but has different characteristics. Consumers may choose a substitute because it’s cheaper or more effective in meeting their needs. Examples abound: wheat or rice for carbohydrates, coffee or tea for caffeine intake, trains or planes for public transportation, and so on. Substitution is typically imperfect since the alternative product will have differences that can’t be quantified.\nThe substitution effect emerges when market conditions change dramatically. The original product might become more expensive or scarce, or perhaps cheaper or more abundant. Shifts in living standards may also lead consumers to prefer one product over another. In all cases, a significant change triggers substitution.\nThis effect also applies to currencies. It becomes evident when official currencies collapse, such as in hyperinflation scenarios, or when they are banned, like in prisons. In these situations, non-traditional items like cars or cigarettes may become monetized.\nWith Bitcoin, the substitution effect manifests uniquely. Each implementation of Bitcoin is limited by a transaction capacity ceiling, often defined by a maximum block size or weight16. Additionally, the total number of bitcoins is capped. When demand for monetary activity increases, instead of creating more bitcoins, the cost of including transactions in a block rises.\n16 Implementing layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network only enhances effective value transfer capacity, as we’ll discuss in Chapter 14.17 This shift to cheaper related systems was observed by Matt Ahlborg, market research consultant for Bitrefill, a platform selling phone top-ups and gift cards.—Matt Ahlborg on Twitter, April 17, 2023, 14:14 UTC: https://twitter.com/MattAhlborg/status/1647966711126147072.This characteristic economically excludes transactions involving amounts too small to justify the cost of recording them on the chain. However, the demand for these small transfers doesn’t vanish. Consequently, some of this demand shifts to alternative chains with lower fees, such as Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash, which offer less security than BTC17.\nSimilarly, what is often perceived as a lack of functionality in Bitcoin-BTC is actually a matter of cost. While it’s possible to simulate all functionalities present on other chains in innovative and indirect ways, it’s cheaper and easier to use protocols that natively incorporate them. This is the case with Monero for privacy or Ethereum-ETH and Ethereum Classic for general programmability.\nTherefore, the substitution effect plays a significant role in Bitcoin and crypto-economic systems in general, explaining the existence of numerous “alternative cryptocurrencies.” Without this effect, economic activity might have naturally consolidated around a single protocol (BTC), but we see that’s not the case, especially during network congestion.\nThe substitution effect accounts for the trend toward extreme crypto-monetary pluralism, where advocates claim that any slightly superior technology could dethrone the market-leading protocol. In this view, they heavily underestimate the network effect, making the opposite mistake of maximalists.",

    "text": "Power and Influence\nTo more precisely understand how the protocol evolves, we should distinguish between power and influence within Bitcoin. In politics, power is the ability to act without third-party consent, ultimately enforced through physical means. Influence, by contrast, is the capacity to sway the decisions of those who hold power, often wielded by religious or ideological forces.\nIn Bitcoin, power translates to the economic authority merchants have over the protocol. Through their nodes, they verify the consensus rules associated with the unit of currency they accept in commerce, thereby adding economic utility to it. However, this direct economic power is frequently influenced by various actors.\nThese influences are considered in the traditional governance model of Bitcoin, which typically involves the trio of developers, miners, and users. These internal system participants engage more or less directly.\nMoreover, influence over the protocol also comes from external entities that impact the system diffusely. While it’s impossible to list all external influences exhaustively, we can identify key ones. These influences operate in three primary ways—through discourse, money, and force—and relate to three actor categories: opinion leaders, financial powers, and state authorities.\nThus, merchants face a range of influences from internal participants like developers, miners, and other users, as well as from external actors such as ideological influencers, financiers, and regulators. These groups interact with each other, forming a complex sociological network that influences the final protocol choice. While fully explaining this complex interplay is beyond our scope, we can sketch a general model by examining internal pressures before exploring the more diffuse external forces.\n\n\n\nA Bitcoin governance model: interactions of the main actor groups in determining the protocol.",

    "text": "The Influence of Developers\nDevelopers constitute the first category of internal actors. They work directly on maintaining and upgrading full or partial implementations of the protocol, contributing to the chain’s health through the software used by merchants and miners. The reference implementation—the most widely used and the model for other implementations—is particularly significant.\nThis intermediary role grants developers considerable influence over merchants and other actors who often lack the expertise to analyze and understand the code directly. Additionally, maintaining high-performance software requires costly effort, not easily replicated. This positions developers strongly in protocol decision-making.\nDevelopers are diverse, with varying opinions. To address this, they often rely on the concept of rough consensus, which isn’t strict consensus but rather an estimation of group sentiment or general will. Utilizing rough consensus practically achieves near unanimity without allowing individual dissent to disrupt the process18. While excluding dissenting voices can be critiqued (since an individual might be correct against the majority), it helps preserve the protocol’s network effect by presenting a unified proposal to merchants.\n18 The concept of rough consensus was used by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 1998, described in their working group procedures: “Working groups make decisions through a ‘rough consensus’ process. IETF consensus does not require that all participants agree, but rather that a general sense of agreement is achieved.”—IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures, September 1998: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2418.For BTC, Bitcoin Core serves as the reference implementation, overseen by maintainers. These maintainers, and developers more broadly, are viewed as the protocol’s guardians. While it’s possible to use an alternative implementation (a “fork”), doing so is costly and often frowned upon, creating inertia favoring Bitcoin Core.\nThis dominance has historically led to the rejection of several dissenting efforts, occasionally resulting in alternative implementations:\n\nIn 2014, Mike Hearn sought to add a getutxos network request to Bitcoin Core but was denied due to lack of consensus, leading to the creation of Bitcoin XT.\nProponents of increasing the network’s transaction capacity during the blocksize war launched multiple implementations in attempts to enact change: Bitcoin XT in mid-2015, Bitcoin Classic in early 2016, Bitcoin Unlimited in mid-2016, and btc1 in mid-2017.\nOpponents of the SegWit upgrade, widely supported by Bitcoin Core, had to develop Bitcoin ABC, which also increased the block size limit, resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash.\nIn 2022, Jeremy Rubin threatened to activate BIP-119 (a soft fork) through miners due to Bitcoin Core’s refusal to integrate his code change but eventually reconsidered, likely after gaining the desired attention.\n\nThus, while developers—especially those with Bitcoin Core—wield significant influence over the protocol, this influence is limited. If they oppose economic interests too starkly, they risk being replaced by other developers.\nA notable example of successful dissent is found in Monero’s early history19. Monero originated as Bitmonero in April 2014, launched by a developer known as thankful_for_today to revive the Bytecoin project, which had experienced massive premining. However, thankful_for_today, self-designated as a “benevolent dictator,” made unilateral changes without consultation, leading to his ousting after a few days. A team of six developers then forked the project, renaming it Monero.\n19 dEBRUYNE, Re: Monero inception—how did bitmonero become monero?, August 11, 2016, 16:21: https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/1011/monero-inception-how-did-bitmonero-become-monero/1024#1024.Another example is the opposition to Bitcoin ABC within the Bitcoin Cash protocol in 2020. Bitcoin ABC, the reference implementation for Bitcoin Cash since 2017, was led by Amaury Séchet. In 2020, he agreed with miners’ suggestions to implement a soft fork redirecting part of the block reward to development teams and integrated this change into Bitcoin ABC in November. An alternative implementation, Bitcoin Cash Node, was created to counter this change, gathering substantial economic support and becoming the reference implementation for what is still called Bitcoin Cash today. Implementing the protocol’s subsidy redirection led to the creation of the XEC protocol.\nTherefore, while developers have real influence over the protocol, it’s fundamentally limited by economic forces when they come into play.",

    "text": "The Pressure from Miners\nMiners represent the second category of actors influencing the protocol. They are individuals or groups who confirm transactions by expending energy through proof of work. As discussed in Chapter 9, miners have the power to select transactions, enabling them, if they hold a majority, to perform double-spending or enforce censorship.\nContrary to some beliefs, miners have direct power over the protocol only insofar as they are a specific type of merchant. They participate in the economy by confirming transactions in exchange for fees. However, their direct power is minimal due to their relatively small economic activity compared to the total.\nNonetheless, miners wield significant influence in decision-making because of their potential to attack the consensus. They can, for instance, influence economic choices during a split by attacking competing branches to undermine them. This was threatened by pro-BSV miners in November 2018 following the separation from BCH20. Similarly, pro-BCHN miners censored the Bitcoin ABC chain in November 2020.\n20 A “hash war” occurred between Bitcoin SV miners, supported by Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre, and Bitcoin ABC miners, backed by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu, involving the redirection of mining power.—Aaron van Wirdum, Week 2: How the Bitcoin Cash ‘Hash War’ Came and Went and Not Much Happened, November 30, 2018: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/week-2-how-bitcoin-cash-hash-war-came-and-went-and-not-much-happened.21 Peter Todd, Forced Soft Forks, January 18, 2016: https://petertodd.org/2016/forced-soft-forks.Miners can also influence economic choices by imposing a soft fork that, in practice, is indistinguishable from censorship. The original consensus rules remain, but their full expression is hindered, potentially prompting merchants to adopt the soft fork by refusing non-conforming transactions and blocks. Developer Peter Todd described this as a “forced soft fork21,” sometimes referred to as an “evil fork.” The situation can resolve in two ways: merchants might continue applying the old rules, creating a fee differential incentivizing miners to revert, or they may adopt a hard fork to counter the soft fork, risking a spiral of splits due to rapid human intervention.\nHowever, miners’ influence ends there. Merchants ultimately determine the rules, and miners are powerless against this reality. It’s incorrect to assert that miners control the protocol (governance by proof of work), as some “big blockers” did during the blocksize war22. If that were true, Bitcoin’s economic system would be doomed, since miners would be naturally incentivized to increase their revenue through inflation, much like central banks.\n22 This viewpoint was held by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who wrote on January 3, 2016: “Fortunately, Bitcoin has an elegant built-in upgrade mechanism. If the majority of Bitcoin miners ‘vote’ for a particular upgrade, it is by definition the new version of Bitcoin.”—Brian Armstrong, Scaling Bitcoin: The Great Block Size Debate, January 3, 2016: https://www.coinbase.com/blog/scaling-bitcoin-the-great-block-size-debate.",

    "section": "The Role of Users",
    "text": "The Role of Users\nNon-merchant users form the third category of internal actors influencing the protocol. Users are often highlighted as having the final say over the protocol23. However, the term “user” is ambiguous and can be misleading because using bitcoin generally involves three distinct actions: accepting it in commerce, holding it over time, and spending it with others. This leads to three theoretical subcategories: merchants, customers, and holders. Only the first has effective power over the protocol; the others wield influence.\n23 “The Bitcoin network isn’t controlled by anyone, much like no one owns the technology behind email. Bitcoin is controlled by all its users globally. While developers improve the software, they can’t force changes to the Bitcoin protocol because users are free to choose which software and version they use. To remain compatible, users need to use software adhering to the same rules. Bitcoin can only function correctly with complete user consensus.”—Bitcoin.org FAQ: https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network.First, consider customers—those exchanging their bitcoins for goods and services, including other currencies. They are the counterpart to merchants; trade is inherently reciprocal: without buyers, there are no sellers, and vice versa. Thus, merchants and customers are interdependent.\nCustomers exert significant influence in determining the protocol. A merchant aiming for business success must accept at least the currency linked to the protocol favored by the majority of customers. The rejection of SegWit2X in 2017 exemplifies customer influence, where users swayed major merchants (exchanges) to abandon plans to double the block size limit in November.\nHowever, the notion that customers share control of the protocol with merchants is flawed. If user dissent is evenly split, the merchant decides which protocol to adopt to offer goods and services at acceptable prices. Ultimately, customers (who spend their bitcoins) don’t add utility to the currency; merchants do.\nNext are holders—those who keep bitcoins over extended periods. Referred to as savers or HODLers (a play on the word “hold”), they emphasize their intent to retain their bitcoins long-term. By doing so, they restrict the money supply, which, coupled with increased demand, elevates the purchasing power of each unit and its exchange rate with the dollar—commonly known as “the price.”\nHolders influence merchants in several ways. First, their savings increase the size of the protocol’s subsidy, boosting the mining budget for protection against double-spending, thus providing greater security for merchants. Second, holding offers the market more potential liquidity, enabling larger participants to enter. Third, a higher price generates significant publicity, attracting media attention through speculative interest. Thus, during a chain split, holders can sell one branch’s currency for another, creating a differential favoring the preferred protocol (as seen in the BTC and BCH split).\nBelieving that the currency’s purchasing power is paramount has led some crypto-economic protocols, like Dash and Tezos, to innovate with internal governance systems resolving protocol disputes through votes proportional to unit ownership (governance by proof of stake). Holders are akin to stakeholders in a company, effectively forming a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).\nHowever, this view holds mainly during Bitcoin’s early phase, where monetary creation constitutes most mining revenue, activity is highly speculative (trading fiat for profit), and the main merchants are exchanges and their clients. Long-term, reduced mining subsidies and stabilization diminish this effect, elevating the importance of non-speculative transactions. While there’s a relationship between utility and price, utility ultimately takes precedence.\nThus, internal actors—developers, miners, customers, and holders—exert significant influence on merchants, impacting protocol determination. However, they’re not the only forces at play; external actors also contribute to the governance mechanism.",

    "section": "The Impact of Opinion Leaders",
    "text": "The Impact of Opinion Leaders\nThe first category of external influences comprises opinion leaders who shape the perspectives of active participants in Bitcoin. These can be individuals (influencers) or groups (media). Their existence stems from the impossibility for individuals to grasp all of Bitcoin’s complexities, leading most users to rely on simplified explanations from others and to base judgments on trust.\nThis dynamic results in certain actors becoming more influential due to personal prestige or control over media outlets. While Bitcoin is often described as leaderless or acephalous24, in reality, some individuals exert more sway in decision-making, regardless of their economic activity.\n24 The term “acephalous currency” was popularized by Jacques Favier and Adli Takkal Bataille in Bitcoin, la monnaie acéphale (2017).Technical experts, presumed to deeply understand the protocol, fall into this category. They might be developers, close associates, educators, or authors. Examples include Adam Back, a former cypherpunk and CEO of Blockstream; Andreas Antonopoulos, a long-time educator; and Aaron van Wirdum, an experienced writer for Bitcoin Magazine and co-host of the podcast Bitcoin Explained.\nPolitically engaged actors who comprehend Bitcoin’s fundamental interests are also influential. Activists like Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation, exemplify this group. Economists who grasp the economic mechanisms at play—such as Saifedean Ammous, Lyn Alden, or France’s financial magistrate Yorick de Mombynes—also hold significant sway.\nFinally, financiers who amassed wealth before or through Bitcoin are influential, serving as role models due to their financial success—a primary attraction for many newcomers to Bitcoin. Figures like Roger Ver, the Winklevoss twins, and Michael Saylor are notable. Elon Musk, a billionaire whose public endorsements revitalized Dogecoin, represents this archetype.\nThese personalities are frequently amplified by media outlets, which themselves influence public opinion by selecting which content to publish or broadcast. They enable the general public, often lacking time or interest to delve deeply, to form opinions.\nThis includes individual content creators producing cryptocurrency-related material on platforms like YouTube, specialized media like news sites (Bitcoin.org, Bitcoin.fr), news outlets (Bitcoin Magazine, Cointelegraph, Coindesk, Bitcoin.com internationally; Cryptoast and Journal du Coin in France), video channels (Grand Angle Crypto), podcasts, and paid newsletters (The Big Whale). Discussion platforms like the historic forum bitcointalk.org, Bitcoin-dedicated subreddits (r/bitcoin, r/btc), and Telegram groups also play roles.\nMainstream media exert influence too, albeit more diffusely. Financial news channels like CNBC or BFM Business occasionally cover crypto-assets. Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, significantly shape public opinion on Bitcoin.",

Financial entities shape protocol determination by choosing to fund the ecosystem and influencers promoting their preferred Bitcoin variant. They might provide resources for commercial expansion (exchange listings), software development, innovative applications, marketing, or regulatory lobbying.\nFunding the reference implementation is particularly critical. Maintaining the software infrastructure isn’t free and doesn’t generate revenue due to the necessary absence of legal usage constraints. Thus, developers need financial support25. Various organizations fund development; as of 2023, key sponsors for Bitcoin Core developers include the charitable organization Brink (funded by major exchanges), MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative, Chaincode Labs, Jack Dorsey’s Block, and the leveraged trading platform BitMEX.\n25 Various funding models have been proposed: the Bitcoin Foundation (2012–2014), venture capital funding with Blockstream (from 2014), crowdfunding with Lighthouse (BTC) in 2014 and Flipstarter (BCH) in 2020, and using the mining subsidy (Dash, Zcash, XEC) since 2015.This funding grants financial powers particular influence, leading to scrutiny, such as criticisms of Blockstream since its inception, notably for investments from entities like AXA. Similarly, the Digital Currency Initiative has faced ambiguity for developing a prototype central bank digital currency for the U.S. while employing Bitcoin Core’s lead maintainer, Wladimir van der Laan.",

    "section": "The State’s Challenge to the Protocol",
    "text": "The State’s Challenge to the Protocol\nFinally, the third method of influencing system actors and thus the protocol is through force, or more precisely, the threat of force—a domain largely monopolized by the state.\nThe state’s existence is deeply intertwined with monetary control, facilitating revenue collection, particularly through seigniorage derived from dominating monetary policy. This creates an antagonistic relationship with Bitcoin, which empowers individuals with total control over their money.\nIt’s logical, then, for the state to attempt to influence the protocol’s evolution or even decree it outright. By defining legal frameworks, it can sway merchants’ choices. However, the state’s political power isn’t limitless. Missteps or abrupt changes may lead merchants to mass disobedience and participation in black markets where authorization isn’t required.\nEconomic power ultimately determines the protocol. Yet, over time, the state can subtly interfere with decisions to alter Bitcoin’s properties. Through strategic legislation, it can maintain broad acceptance, ensuring much of the economy remains in regulated markets. It can also influence key actors in Bitcoin’s governance model—developers, miners, media—without prompting resistance.\nFinancial regulations serve as preparatory steps for such influence, imposing constraints on exchanges (principal merchants) bridging bitcoin and official currencies. Initiated in 2013, these regulations mandate stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Transaction (KYT) procedures, making anonymity increasingly difficult. They habituate economic actors to compliance and limit the number of participants by imposing burdensome requirements on smaller exchanges. Such regulations may also apply broadly to merchants, with laws in most jurisdictions requiring declaration of capital gains relative to national currency.\nConsidering how the protocol might be attacked, acceptance of bitcoin could be declared illegal without alternatives, wiping out the regulated market’s merchant economy instantaneously. The system’s utility and the unit’s exchange value would plummet.\nTotal bans have occurred in countries like Morocco, Algeria, Bolivia, and Nepal. Others have partially banned aspects of the economy, such as exchanges with national currency (China), the sale of goods and services domestically (Turkey, Ecuador, Thailand), or acquisition by financial actors (Iran, Nigeria). Except for China, these bans haven’t been enacted by major powers, leaving bitcoin usage legal in most of the world. A truly impactful ban would require international coordination to diminish Bitcoin’s utility significantly.\nThe effectiveness of such bans is debatable due to enforcement challenges. Unpopular prohibitions risk expanding black markets. Thus, it’s plausible that such an attack would involve offering a state-controlled Bitcoin alternative to appease the more “pragmatic” segments of the economy.\nTo counter Bitcoin, the state might deploy its own protocol version to gradually erode Bitcoin’s fundamental properties. This altered Bitcoin would be legalized and favorably regulated, while the original would be outlawed. Compliant actors might enjoy short-term price increases, while dissident merchants face penalties.\nInitially, censorship via soft forks could be implemented based on general AML/CFT standards, possibly coupled with active miner censorship. Compliant actors might justify their stance by asserting that certain transactions don’t belong on the Bitcoin chain.\nSubsequently, a soft fork might extend to all transactions, requiring state authorization for each. At this stage, staunch conformists might still believe the monetary policy remains intact.\nThirdly, a tax-imposing soft fork could be introduced, levying fixed transaction fees (akin to VAT) or extracting demurrage based on holding periods. Such measures could aim to regulate bitcoin’s deflationary nature and address wealth inequality.\nFinally, an inflationary hard fork might be enacted. By this point, remaining participants would be entirely different from the originals. The essence of “Bitcoin” would be wholly eradicated, with the system resembling a central bank digital currency.\nThough hypothetical, this scenario logically follows from state influence over money and is somewhat inevitable. However, it simultaneously presupposes the emergence of a parallel economy where bitcoin acceptance occurs clandestinely. Facing increasing censorship, resistance would grow, and the official chain’s diminishing utility would drive non-conformist merchants away.\nEventually, a split would occur. If the state version is minority, it would naturally diverge (optimistic scenario). If it’s majority, the clandestine version might require a hard fork to survive (pessimistic scenario). Either way, Bitcoin’s restoration would proceed from the free chain, with no protocol ambiguities. However, this chain could face mining attacks, as detailed in Chapter 9.",

    "text": "Two Layers of Security\nBitcoin embodies a digital currency concept resistant to censorship and inflation. These two fundamental properties are complementary but require different security measures. Resistance to censorship relies on mining security; resistance to inflation depends on commercial security.\nDetermining the protocol—or protocols, since multiple can exist—is achieved by merchants broadly defined as those accepting bitcoin in exchange for goods, services, or other currencies. Merchants verify consensus rules through their nodes. Their power over the protocol is proportional to their potential economic activity, estimable by actual revenues, and influenced by the network effect, which causes collective utility from merchants to grow super-linearly.\nVarious influences affect merchants’ protocol choices. While the intricate interactions of this complex network are hard to fully comprehend, we’ve outlined key elements here. Notably, the state’s significant influence cannot be overlooked; it could directly attack the protocol by coercing merchants and other actors.\nFor the Bitcoin protocol to be truly robust, economic activity must be decentralized, much like mining. Merchants (or small merchant groups) need to run their own nodes so that, if an authority mandates rule changes, risks are distributed across the economy, allowing Bitcoin to continue clandestinely.\nLong-term consensus on the protocol is essential. Bitcoin’s brief history is filled with disruptions showing that changing consensus rules isn’t always smooth. Time is needed to distinguish beneficial modifications from detrimental ones.",

    "text": "Transactions and Coins\nIn Bitcoin, transactions play a central role. The protocol is designed to exchange value in line with its monetary function, handling transfers of ownership. The entire system is conceived to facilitate the construction, signing, and dissemination of transactions, their storage in memory in the mempool, and their addition to the ledger by inclusion in a block.\nEach transaction consists of one or more inputs and one or more outputs. A transaction output simply comprises a destination indication and an amount in units (satoshis). An input generally refers to a previous transaction output, except in the case of the reward transaction where it represents a “coinbase” creating new units from monetary issuance and transaction fees.\nA transaction’s identifier (transaction identifier or txid) is the hash of its raw data, obtained via double SHA-256 hashing. Each transaction output is characterized by the identifier of the transaction from which it originates and by its position in that transaction, known as the index. This output point (outpoint) serves as a provenance indication. An example of an output point is f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16:0.\nContrary to what the description of ownership in Chapter 7 might suggest, the destination and provenance of units are not strictly addresses but locking scripts—that is, small programs that determine their spending conditions. Each output thus creates a script that locks the funds in a specific way. Most often, this script contains a public key or a public key hash, which can be interpreted as an address by the wallet.\nFor an input to be valid, it must contain an unlocking script whose execution, combined with that of the locking script, succeeds. Generally, this unlocking script contains a digital signature corresponding to the public key linked to the previous locking script: verifying the signature ensures that the person spending the units is the owner.\nThis mechanism means that the model of representing units is counterintuitive. The protocol does not perceive accounts with balances updated by transactions, as is the case in Ethereum, for example. It simply sees transaction outputs held by owners, similar to coins in the physical world.\nThus, Bitcoin implements the concept of digital coin that was discussed within the cypherpunk community in the 1990s. In the Cyphernomicon, for example, Tim May considered such a thing impossible due to the double-spending problem. Satoshi Nakamoto, by discovering a way to solve this problem, made the concept viable and integrated it into Bitcoin. In the white paper, he described the notion of a digital coin as follows:\n“We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing the hash of the previous transaction and the next owner’s public key and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership1.”\nIn Bitcoin, the existing coins are therefore the unspent transaction outputs, commonly abbreviated as UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs), meaning the transaction outputs that have not been used as inputs in another transaction. The set of these coins, the UTXO set, constitutes the ledger of ownership. It represents the system’s state, which can be retrieved from its history—the blockchain.\nEach coin consists of an amount in units (satoshis) and a locking script. Thus, there can be coins of one billion satoshis (10 bitcoins) as well as coins of 546 satoshis (0.00000546 bitcoin).\nThe locking script of a coin most often contains a public key or a determined hash, so the coin can be viewed as being held by the corresponding address. Therefore, two coins sharing the same locking script are held by the same address. An account in Bitcoin corresponds to all the addresses controlled by a user. The balance is retrieved by scanning all the UTXOs to find the coins held by these addresses.\nThis coin-based representation model allows us to view the transaction mechanism as a coin minting process. Each transaction involves melting together one or more bitcoin coins in inputs and minting one or more coins in outputs. This is how Bitcoin’s distributed timestamp server replaces the centralized digital minting present in eCash and RPOW, for example, which allowed systematic replacement of coins.\nConstructing a transaction involves gathering coins of sufficient value in inputs to melt them and mint new ones. Generally, two coins are created: the first is sent to the address provided by the recipient to make the payment (primary output), and the second is sent back to one of the sender’s addresses to “give themselves change” (change output). The difference between the input amount and the output amount is accounted for in the miner’s reward as transaction fees.\nLet’s consider some examples while ignoring these fees and assuming Alice wants to make a payment. If Alice has a coin of 12 mBTC (0.012 BTC) and wants to give 7 mBTC to Bob, she must construct and sign a transaction using this 12 mBTC coin as input, and outputs of 7 mBTC to Bob’s address and 5 mBTC back to her own address. This transaction is represented in Figure 12.2.\nIf Alice doesn’t have a coin with a face value greater than 7 mBTC, she must gather coins to collect sufficient input amount, for example, a coin of 6 mBTC and one of 2 mBTC. As before, she must create a change output back to herself to give herself the change. In this case, illustrated in Figure 12.3, one can deduce by observing the transaction that the 7 mBTC coin is the payment result, as it would be economically irrational to merge multiple coins to send 1 mBTC.\nIf Alice wishes to transfer all her funds to another account, she gathers all her coins (6 mBTC, 4 mBTC, 2 mBTC) to send them to a single address, as shown in Figure 12.4. This is called a wallet consolidation, which can be identified by an external observer due to the uniqueness of the output.\nWe see that transactions are not raw transfers from one address to another but combinations and divisions of digital coins. This functioning is somewhat counterintuitive but proves useful for the system’s scalability by allowing independent processing of coins, and for user confidentiality by not encouraging the consolidation of funds on a single address and facilitating the implementation of anonymization techniques like coin mixing. This model is therefore particularly suited to monetary use.",

    "text": "The Virtual Machine\nThe scripts within transactions make Bitcoin a system of programmable money. These scripts allow embedding various spending conditions, also called clauses, that go beyond requiring a simple signature, such as knowing a secret, waiting for a specific time period, or producing multiple signatures.\nBitcoin’s implementation creates an abstract machine whose operation is replicated on all nodes of the network thanks to the consensus algorithm. It is simulated via software implementation, hence referred to as a virtual machine. More precisely, it is a state machine, whose current state is the set of existing coins—that is, the set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs)—and whose transitions are the transactions that destroy coins to create new ones. These transactions are assembled into blocks that are validated at regular intervals by miners. The propagation of a block across the network updates the state of the virtual machine, which is (except in the case of a fork) shared by all nodes.\nWithin a transaction, unlocking coins is done by executing scripts. The scripts are predicates in the mathematical sense—that is, incomplete expressions that become propositions that can be evaluated when completed by one or more elements. Thus, spending consists of combining the locking script of the previous output and the unlocking script, and executing them one after the other: the unlocking script first, followed by the locking script. Using the coin as a transaction input is approved if the execution succeeds.\nThe scripts are written in Bitcoin’s internal programming language, designed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and unimaginatively named “Script.” This programming language functions similarly to Forth, a language used in the 1970s and 1980s. It is based primarily on two data stacks, which are data structures operating on the “last in, first out” (LIFO) principle. The language essentially acts on the primary stack, making it the most important; the secondary stack allows data to be set aside during script execution.\nSatoshi Nakamoto included this scripting system in Bitcoin to enable it to handle a wide variety of use cases. In June 2010, in response to Gavin Andresen, he wrote on the forum:\n“The nature of Bitcoin is such that, from version 0.1 launched, its basic operation was set in stone for the rest of its existence. That’s why I wanted to design Bitcoin to support all the transaction types I could think of. The problem was that each type required special support code and data fields, whether used or not, and could only cover one special case at a time. It would have been an explosion of special cases. The solution was script, which generalized the problem so that contracting parties could describe their transactions as predicates that network nodes evaluated. The nodes only need to understand the transaction to the extent of evaluating whether the sender’s conditions are met2.”\n2 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Transactions and Scripts: DUP HASH160 ... EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG, June 17, 2010, 18:46:08: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195.msg1611#msg1611.The language consists of more than a hundred operators, also called opcodes, which act on the primary stack in one way or another. The operators are numbers encoded on 1 byte (ranging from 0 to 255) but are usually designated by a name describing their function to make reading more understandable to humans. They are written in uppercase and are often prefixed with OP_, though the prefix can be omitted when unambiguous. For example, the operator that verifies a signature (0xac) is noted OP_CHECKSIG or CHECKSIG.\nOperators ranging from 1 to 75, sometimes noted as OP_PUSHBYTES_X, act by pushing data of sizes ranging from 1 to 75 bytes onto the stack. Using additional specific operators (noted OP_PUSHDATA_Y) allows for placing larger information onto the stack. Although this notation can be used, it is generally simpler to enclose an element in angle brackets to indicate that it is pushed onto the stack. For example, writing &lt;signature&gt; within a script means that the signature is pushed onto the stack.\nThe value returned at the end of script execution is a boolean, so the script can be valid—in which case spending the coin is approved—or invalid, in which case the transaction is rejected entirely. The script is valid if and only if the value TRUE (“true”) is present at the top of the stack at the end of execution. It is invalid if this is not the case or if its execution halted before completion.\nHowever, the Script language is limited. Nothing in its basic design allows for loops or access to data outside the transaction, unlike Ethereum’s language, which is nearly Turing-complete. This peculiarity means it is less flexible but has the advantage of being simpler to understand and thus more secure.\nA typical script example, presented by Andreas Antonopoulos3, involves solving a simple equation involving addition. If we consider the equation (17 + x = 38), the corresponding locking script is:\n3 Andreas M. Antonopoulos, “Transactions,” in Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain, 2nd edition, 2017, pp. 117–148.&lt;17&gt; ADD &lt;38&gt; EQUAL\nAnyone knowing the answer can spend the coin, which is admittedly not very secure. The spend requires providing the unlocking script containing only the solution to the equation, namely 21:\n&lt;21&gt;\nThe successive execution of these two scripts (see Figure 12.5) proceeds as follows: 1) the value 21 is placed on the stack; 2) the value 17 is placed above it; 3) the OP_ADD operator adds the two top values on the stack and replaces them with their sum, here 38; 4) the value 38 is placed at the top of the stack; 5) the OP_EQUAL operator compares the two top values on the stack and replaces them with the equality boolean, here TRUE. The script execution is thus successful.\n\n\n\nExecution of an addition script on the data stack.\n\n\nIf the value had been different, say 22, the last operation would have returned the boolean FALSE, and the spend transaction would have been invalidated.\nMany different spending conditions can be implemented with this system. Some of these conditions are simple, such as knowing a specific secret or producing a valid signature corresponding to a particular public key. Verifying knowledge of a secret (whose hash is specified in the UTXO) is done with the following scripts that push the secret onto the stack, hash it with SHA-256, and compare the result to the hash:\n&lt;secret&gt; SHA256 &lt;hash&gt; EQUAL\nSimilarly, verifying the validity of a signature is achieved with the following scripts that push the signature, then the public key onto the stack before checking their correspondence:\n&lt;signature&gt; &lt;public key&gt; CHECKSIG\nMoreover, there are more advanced conditions like timelocks. These allow funds in the coin to be locked until a specific date (absolute timelock) or for a specified duration (relative timelock). The former is implemented via the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY operator, whose technical specifics are described in BIP-65. The latter is applied by the OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY opcode described in BIP-112.",

    "text": "Classic Schemes\nThe Script language allows for various diverse and varied functionalities. In Bitcoin’s early days, the system was relatively free and allowed people to write whatever they wanted in scripts without discrimination. However, this situation was considerably risky. The main reason was that the functioning of opcodes had not yet been verified and tested, as demonstrated by the discovery in July 2010 of a vulnerability enabled by certain binary operators (CVE-2010-5137). This is why, at the end of 2010, under Gavin Andresen’s initiative, it was decided to restrict the system’s programmability4.\n4 Gavin Andresen, svn r197: IsStandard check for transactions, December 7, 2010, 13:58:33 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2129.msg27744#msg27744.This restriction was applied by imposing standard script schemes, which meant that nodes configured by default would no longer relay transactions containing scripts that did not comply with this standard. Thus, this was not a restriction of the global consensus rules but of the local mempool rules that apply to transaction transmission. Standard schemes that made things simpler and safer were developed over the years. As of 2023, the standard transaction output schemes numbered eight: P2PK, P2PKH, P2MS, P2SH, NULLDATA, P2WPKH, P2WSH, and P2TR.\n\nP2PK: Pay to Public Key\nThe first scheme is Pay to Public Key (P2PK), which can be literally translated as “pay to the public key.” It involves creating a coin linked to the recipient’s public key, which only they can spend by signing with their private key. The locking script enabling this type of payment is:\n&lt;public key&gt; CHECKSIG\nThe presence of the public key explains why “scriptPubKey” is sometimes used to refer to the locking script in general, regardless of its content.\nAt the time of spending, the recipient must use an unlocking script containing simply their signature:\n&lt;signature&gt;\nThe presence of the signature in this script explains why “scriptSig” is sometimes used to refer to the unlocking script in general, regardless of its content. The successive execution of these two scripts allows, as we’ve seen, to verify that the signature provided by the user corresponds to their public key, making it valid.\nThe P2PK scheme was used in Bitcoin’s early days for receiving payments by IP (P2IP) and for collecting mining rewards. It has now fallen into disuse in favor of a rival scheme: P2PKH.\n\n\nP2PKH: Pay to Public Key Hash\nThe Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH) scheme, literally translated as “pay to the hash of the public key,” is the second type of receipt format that appeared in Bitcoin from the beginning due to Satoshi Nakamoto’s design. This scheme allows for a payment not to a public key but to a hash of a public key, while ensuring that the interpreter still verifies the validity of the signature concerning the public key when spending the funds. The public key hash is considered the essential data (“payload”) of the address, which in this case always begins with a 1, such as 1FjBKPQ7MTiPSDkJ2ZwPgAXUKQ8yoGbVJX. The locking script here is:\nDUP HASH160 &lt;public key hash&gt; EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG\nAnd the unlocking script is:\n&lt;signature&gt; &lt;public key&gt;\nThe execution of the two scripts allows: 1) verifying that hashing the public key with the HASH-160 function equals the hash specified in the script; 2) verifying that the signature corresponds to the public key.\nThe advantage of this scheme is that it allows for shorter addresses (the information to encode is only 20 bytes instead of 33 or 65 bytes for a public key), which is why Satoshi Nakamoto implemented it. Additionally, by not revealing the public key until the time of spending, this scheme increases security against the very hypothetical threat of quantum computers.\n\n\nP2MS: Pay to MultiSig\nThe Pay to MultiSig (P2MS) scheme, meaning “pay to multisignature,” is a multiparty signature scheme requiring the signatures of M people among N predetermined participants (“M-of-N”). It was standardized in a form limited to 3 participants in March 2012 with the release of version 0.6.0 of the software. The locking script is as follows:\nM &lt;public key 1&gt; ... &lt;public key N&gt; N CHECKMULTISIG\nThe corresponding unlocking script is:\n&lt;dummy (0)&gt; &lt;signature 1&gt; ... &lt;signature M&gt;\nThe presence of the dummy (usually 0) is due to a defect in Satoshi’s implementation of the execution of the OP_CHECKMULTISIG operator, which requires one extra element. Developers did not deem it appropriate to fix this defect, as the correction would have been a hard fork.\nThis scheme, particularly demanding in terms of setup, motivated the creation of the P2SH scheme.\n\n\nP2SH: Pay to Script Hash\nThe Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) scheme, which can be literally translated as “pay to the script hash,” extends the idea behind P2PKH, with the only difference being that the hashed data is not a public key but the script itself! The script in question is then called the redeem script to differentiate it from the unlocking script. Its hash is the essential data of the address, which always begins with a 3, like 3K8Ps6Ayw5ZaKDaLZjfGo3mTgDsc1VXZ8d.\nThis scheme allows the user to include any script without discrimination on its format, provided it respects certain limits. It also enables receiving funds from almost all existing wallets, with the burden of constructing and unlocking the script falling solely on the recipient and not shared with the sender, as in the case of using raw scripts.\nThe locking script for the P2SH scheme is:\nHASH160 &lt;redeem script hash&gt; EQUAL\nAnd the unlocking script is a script of the form:\n[unlocking elements] &lt;redeem script&gt;\nThe execution of P2SH is more complex than previous schemes, which can be explained by the context in which it was developed. The idea of implementing a script scheme that uses a script hash like the public key hash in P2PKH emerged in 2011 through several proposals. It became more concrete with Nicolas van Saberhagen’s proposal of the OP_EVAL operator on October 2—a code operation that allowed recursive execution of a script within another script5. Gavin Andresen explained how to make it a soft fork by replacing the no-effect instruction OP_NOP16.\n5 Nicolas van Saberhagen (ByteCoin), OP_EVAL proposal, October 2, 2011, 00:49:19 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=46538.msg553689#msg553689.6 Gavin Andresen, Re: OP_EVAL proposal, October 2, 2011, 20:42:32 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=46538.msg554620#msg554620.The OP_EVAL operator was intended to form a new standard scheme. The locking script would have been:\nDUP HASH160 &lt;redeem script hash&gt; EQUALVERIFY EVAL\nwhile the unlocking script would have been the same as for P2SH. The successive execution of these two scripts would have allowed, first, verifying the hash of the redeem script matches the specified hash; then, in a second step, executing the redeem script and combining it with the unlocking elements. However, this solution was not accepted, being judged too dangerous because of its recursion power. An alternative model, more restrictive, was preferred: P2SH.\nThe execution of P2SH works exactly like the scheme related to OP_EVAL, except that part of the script is not explicitly indicated. On one hand, verifying the correspondence between the specified hash and the redeem script is done by the locking script. On the other hand, the evaluation of the redeem script is performed implicitly thanks to an exception added to the source code, causing network nodes recognizing the scheme to interpret it differently. In Bitcoin Core, this condition can be observed within the VerifyScript function of the interpreter.\nThe proposal was codified in BIP-16. While this solution is practical, it creates complexity and is not very elegant. As Gavin Andresen said in the introductory explanation of this BIP:\n“Recognizing a ‘special’ form of scriptPubKey and performing additional validation when it is detected is ugly. However, the general consensus is that the alternatives are either even uglier, more complex to implement, and/or dangerously extend the language’s expressive power7.”\n7 Gavin Andresen, BIP-16: Pay to Script Hash, January 3, 2012: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki#rationale.The P2SH scheme was eventually activated on April 1, 2012, as a soft fork, despite notable opposition from Luke-Jr, who proposed an alternative operator, OP_CHECKHASHVERIFY, described in BIP-17.\n\n\nNULLDATA\nThe NULLDATA scheme, literally meaning “insignificant data,” is a scheme for embedding arbitrary data on the chain. It is the fourth classic scheme and was standardized with the arrival of version 0.9.0 of Bitcoin Core in March 2014. It is based on the OP_RETURN instruction, whose effect is to terminate script execution and render the corresponding coin unspendable8. The locking script of the scheme always begins with OP_RETURN and is followed by the pushed data:\n8 The OP_RETURN instruction initially returned the value at the top of the stack, hence its name. However, in July 2010, the discovery of the “1 RETURN bug”, which allowed spending any transaction output via the unlock script TRUE RETURN, prompted Satoshi Nakamoto to disable this functionality by making it return FALSE systematically. See Satoshi Nakamoto, reverted makefile.unix wx-config – version 0.3.6 (git commit), July 29, 2010, 18:27:12 UTC: https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/119/.RETURN [arbitrary data]\nThe output containing this script is exempt from the standard dust limit, which is currently 546 satoshis for P2PKH outputs, allowing it to be 0 satoshis. Moreover, due to their inherently unspendable nature, outputs can be pruned from nodes’ UTXO sets. All this makes this scheme the standard means of inscribing information on the ledger.",

    "text": "Types of Signatures\nThe programmability of Bitcoin is not only derived from its programming language but also from the signature system, which allows selecting which part of the transaction is signed. This aspect of programmability is implemented through the existence of an indicator, called the signature hash type or sighash, which is added to the unsigned transaction and then to the signature itself. This indicates which part of the transaction should be hashed before being submitted to the signing algorithm, hence its name.\nThe signature type is constructed from several signature flags that can be combined. The four existing signature flags are:\n\nSIGHASH_ALL (0x01), indicating that all outputs are signed;\nSIGHASH_SINGLE (0x03), allowing only a single output to be signed;\nSIGHASH_NONE (0x02), indicating that no outputs are signed;\nSIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY (0x80), allowing only a single input to be signed.\n\nThe three flags concerning outputs can be associated with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, allowing for six different signature types in total, represented in Figure 12.6. The most frequent signature type is obviously SIGHASH_ALL, although some other types can occasionally be useful. Notably, SIGHASH_ALL | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY allows constructing anyone-can-pay transactions, whose outputs are determined but where each participant can sign their own input without knowing the others.\n\n\n\nThe different signature types in Bitcoin.\n\n\nThese flags were implemented from the beginning by Satoshi Nakamoto within the prototype. One was logically missing, which Satoshi Nakamoto probably deemed unnecessary: the one that didn’t sign any inputs. However, with the development of payment channels for the Lightning Network, developers realized it could be useful. In this spirit, the SIGHASH_NOINPUT flag was proposed in February 2016 by Joseph Poon9.\n9 Joseph Poon, [bitcoin-dev] SIGHASH_NOINPUT in Segregated Witness, February 26, 2016, 01:07:46 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-February/012460.html.This signature type could be partially implemented in BTC through BIP-118, which provides for the integration of two new flags within Taproot scripts: SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT and SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT. It would improve the functioning of the Lightning Network by implementing the Eltoo protocol, which relies on the construction of floating transactions.",

    "section": "SegWit: The Segregated Witness",
    "text": "SegWit: The Segregated Witness\nSegWit, short for Segregated Witness, is a protocol upgrade that took place on Litecoin-LTC and Bitcoin-BTC in 2017. It involved separating the unlocking data of transaction inputs, such as signatures, into a separate data structure called the witness (witness) to eliminate transaction malleability. SegWit thus constituted a profound restructuring of transactions.\nBeyond correcting malleability, SegWit brought increased transaction capacity and script versioning to facilitate future upgrades. It also improved the signing algorithm to avoid redundant hashing during verification and to make offline signing more secure.\n\nMalleability\nSegWit originates from the problem of transaction malleability, an issue identified since January 2012. In Bitcoin, transactions are malleable in the sense that they can be slightly modified after their broadcast without becoming invalid in the eyes of the network. This property stems from the fact that a signature cannot include itself and, consequently, the unlocking script is not signed with the rest of the transaction. Malleability can thus take two forms: malleability intrinsic to the ECDSA algorithm, which is based on a random number to produce a signature (malleability by the signer); malleability arising from the form of inputs’ signatures and unlocking scripts (malleability by a third party).\nMalleability is not prohibitive for fund security, but it allows modifying the transaction identifier after its publication, which can be problematic in certain situations. For instance, between February 9 and 11, 2014, Mt. Gox and other exchange platforms suffered attacks exploiting this transaction malleability. Withdrawal transactions were modified by attackers, making the platforms’ poorly configured software infrastructure believe that these transactions had not been confirmed. The hackers saw their accounts re-credited while simultaneously retaining the withdrawn bitcoins. These attacks led to a total loss of 64,564 bitcoins10.\n10 For the malleability attack against Mt. Gox, see Ken Shirriff, The Bitcoin malleability attack graphed hour by hour, February 15, 2014: https://www.righto.com/2014/02/the-bitcoin-malleability-attack-hour-by.html. See also Christian Decker, Roger Wattenhofer, Bitcoin Transaction Malleability and MtGox, March 26, 2014: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6676.pdf.Proposals attempted to correct malleability by a third party by constraining transaction forms as much as possible. In this spirit, BIP-62 was created in March 2014, one of whose requirements (the standard encoding of signatures described in BIP-66) was included in the consensus rules on July 4, 2015. However, these changes did not apply to malleability by the signer, creating a demand for a generalized fix.\nThis malleability meant that any actor participating in a multiparty signature contract could modify the transaction and thus its identifier at any time. It significantly hindered the implementation of the Lightning Network, whose payment channels, as we’ll see later, rely on unpublished transactions that need to be referenced and involve multiple signatures.\nThe solution was to exclude the unlocking scripts from the transaction hash calculation so that a change in these scripts would not affect the identifier. This idea was initially proposed by Gregory Maxwell in August 2013 on IRC before being implemented within the alpha version of the Elements sidechain model, announced on June 8, 2015, by Blockstream. On the same day, Gregory Maxwell presented this version of Elements including Segregated Witness in a developer seminar in San Francisco, describing the witness as “a specific value that is a concrete proof of an existential assertion11.”\n11 SF Bitcoin Developers, Sidechains: Bringing New Elements to Bitcoin (video), June 8, 2015: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twynh6xIKUc.This solution was adapted for Bitcoin in the fall of 2015 to be applied as a soft fork. The SegWit upgrade was officially introduced to the community by developer Pieter Wuille on December 7, 2015, during the Scaling Bitcoin II conference in Hong Kong. Essentially, it involved moving the unlocking scripts to the transaction’s witness. Two identifiers were then calculated: the classic identifier (txid), which does not include the witness, and the complete identifier (noted wtxid for witness transaction identifier), which covers the entire transaction. The complete identifiers were grouped in a second Merkle tree, the witness tree, whose root was placed in the block’s coinbase transaction, ensuring all data was committed in the proof-of-work calculation. On the other hand, transactions and blocks remained valid for nodes that had not been upgraded.\nSegWit has been active since August 24, 2017. The absence of the unlocking script in the calculation of the classic identifier eliminates malleability entirely, both by signers and by third parties.\n\n\nIncreasing Transaction Capacity\nSegWit also had the indirect effect of creating an extension block and increasing transaction capacity. Indeed, nodes following the old rules did not see the witness, so they did not count it in the block size. The question then was what limit to place on the witness.\nThe answer was to invent a new metric to measure the impact of transactions and blocks on the network: weight, which is a weighted average of the base size and the witness size. Expressed in weight units, it is defined as the sum of four times the base size ((s_b)) and the witness size ((s_w)):\n\\[\nw = 4 \\times s_b + s_w\n\\]\nIt follows a virtual size ((s_v)) defined as the sum of the base size and one-quarter of the witness size, that is: \\(s_v = s_b + \\frac{s_w}{4}\\). The block size limit became a block weight limit, which was set at 4 million units at the time of the upgrade and remained the same as of November 2023.\nThus, fees initially calculated in satoshis per byte (sat/B) have, since SegWit, been measured in satoshis per virtual byte (sat/vB). Miners select transactions based on this rate to maximize profitability relative to this limit. This effect is only valid if the limit is reached.\nWith SegWit, the idea is to weight the impact of inputs compared to outputs on fee calculation. If activity reaches the capacity ceiling, outputs are four times more expensive to record on-chain than the unlocking scripts contained in the inputs. The upgrade, in addition to providing a discount that encourages its use, created a disincentive to burden the UTXO set. The factor of 4 approximates material weighting12.\n12 SegWit Resources, Why a discount factor of 4? Why not 2 or 8?, January 13, 2017: https://medium.com/segwit-co/why-a-discount-factor-of-4-why-not-2-or-8-bbcebe91721e.13 A transaction with 2 inputs and 2 outputs of type P2WPKH measures 372 bytes and weighs 834 weight units at most. Thus, it’s possible to include 4,796 transactions in a block, allowing us to calculate its actual size.This limit of 4 million weight units is indicative. The actual block size generally does not reach 4 MB due to the shape of transactions. The data contained in normal transactions are not grouped in the witness, so they do not fully utilize the permitted block space. For example, taking a block consisting solely of transactions with 2 inputs and 2 outputs using SegWit, its actual size would be 1.784 MB13.\nTransactions where the unlocking data are larger benefit more from this additional block space. This is the case for transactions using multisignature, such as payment channel closures. It is possible to approach the 4 MB size by maximizing the data size contained in the witness. This was done on February 1, 2023, with the creation of a 3.955 MB block whose witness was used to inscribe an image14.\n14 See block 774,628, identifier 0000000000000000000515e202c8ae73c8155fc472422d7593af87aa74f2cf3d, whose size was 3,955,272 bytes and which included a transaction measuring 3,938,383 bytes on its own.\n\nScript Versioning\nFinally, the SegWit upgrade introduced script versioning, allowing the deployment of future upgrades. The version thus indicates which rules are applied. The first version of SegWit in 2017 used version 0, and the deployment of Taproot in 2021 was done using version 1.\nThere are three native output types related to SegWit for now: the P2WPKH scheme, the P2WSH scheme, and the P2TR scheme.\n\n\nP2WPKH: Pay to Witness Public Key Hash\nThe Pay to Witness Public Key Hash (P2WPKH) scheme, literally meaning “pay to the witness hash of the public key,” is the first scheme implemented by SegWit. The public key hash is obtained by standard hashing (SHA-256 followed by RIPEMD-160). The apparent locking script is then:\n&lt;version (0)&gt; &lt;hash160 of the public key&gt;\nThis script resembles an anyone-can-spend script that anyone could spend, but the interpreter adds an additional condition to prevent this. The output type is detected based on its form: the SegWit version (here 0) and the hash size (here 20 bytes). The version and hash form the essential information of the address, which is encoded using the Bech32 format and always starts with bc1q, such as bc1q5x9a0aqmgtrucm4l5n0y8e4kxfy9xm4udhygr2.\nThe unlocking script is empty. The unlocking data are contained in the transaction’s witness. The part of the witness corresponding to the input is:\n&lt;2&gt; &lt;signature&gt; &lt;public key&gt;\n\n\nP2WSH: Pay to Witness Script Hash\nThe Pay to Witness Script Hash (P2WSH) scheme, literally translated as “pay to the witness script hash,” is the transcription of P2SH for SegWit. The hash of the redeem script is obtained by SHA-256 out of concern for a collision in RIPEMD-160 in the case of an address generated by multiple people15. The locking script is:\n15 Gavin Andresen, [bitcoin-dev] Time to worry about 80-bit collision attacks or not?, January 7, 2016, 19:02:05 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-January/012198.html.&lt;version (0)&gt; &lt;sha256 hash of the redeem script&gt;\nAgain, this script is apparently anyone-can-spend. The output type is detected by the interpreter based on its form: the SegWit version (here 0) and the hash size (here 32 bytes). The address is again composed of these two pieces of information and encoded using the Bech32 format.\nThe unlocking script is empty. The unlocking data are contained in the transaction’s witness. The part of the witness corresponding to the input is:\n&lt;number of elements + 1&gt; [unlocking elements] &lt;redeem script&gt;\nIn both cases, the hash is also called the “witness program.”\n\n\nNested Types (P2SH-P2WPKH, P2SH-P2WSH)\nSegWit also modified the P2SH format to include new exceptions. These exceptions correspond to the nested types (nested) P2SH-P2WPKH and P2SH-P2WSH. Their functioning involves including the previous locking scripts (version + hash) in a P2SH output as redeem scripts. The redeem script is then executed differently to call upon the data contained in the witness.\nThese nested types facilitated the transition to SegWit by allowing wallets that hadn’t been updated to send funds to these addresses. Using native SegWit addresses remains more advantageous.\n\n\nP2TR: Pay to Taproot\nThe latest scheme to come into effect is the Pay to Taproot (P2TR) scheme, whose name can be translated as “pay to Taproot.” This scheme allows receiving a payment to an external public key that hides a private key used to sign fund transfers, or to the root of a Merkle tree containing contract clauses (MAST). Since the payment destination is a public key, it is somewhat a return to P2PK. The locking script present in the transaction output is:\n&lt;version (1)&gt; &lt;Taproot public key&gt;\nThe public key in question is 32 bytes in size. The version and public key constitute the elements of the address. The address is encoded using the Bech32m format, a variant of the Bech32 encoding that corrected a small bug in checksum calculation. The resulting address always starts with bc1p, such as bc1pqlqqhzrg60v5h87r8lugusrddgz0j306shcupthy0tdqaqurwn8qr8qsej. Unlocking the output is done with a simple signature or by executing the MAST.\nAll these major changes make SegWit a profound protocol upgrade that has brought many things to Bitcoin. The requirement to proceed via a soft fork explains the form it took, and it can only be understood in the context in which it was activated. However, this upgrade also brought significant drawbacks, the two main ones being the technical debt that increases the cost of maintaining and improving the code, and the weakening of overall confidentiality due to the emergence of new partially adopted address types. SegWit was therefore far from a perfect upgrade.",

    "text": "Coin Mixing\nThe fact that transactions are published on the chain leads to surveillance. As we noted earlier, it is possible to make assumptions to deduce what is really happening on the chain, assuming the user seeks to minimize the fees paid within their transactions. These heuristics (such as the co-spending heuristic, the change output heuristic, or the wallet fingerprint heuristic) form the basis of a discipline called chain analysis, which consists of cross-referencing these observations with the identification of real actors to draw conclusions about their actual economic activity. This is why the term “transparency” of the chain is sometimes used.\nHowever, this transparency is relative, as the chain’s data do not reveal individuals’ identities: the system is pseudonymous in the sense that it records movements between addresses, not between people. Bitcoin’s privacy model, described by Satoshi Nakamoto in the white paper in 2008, thus involves keeping secret the link between a person’s identity and their addresses16.\n16 “The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The need to publicly announce all transactions precludes this method but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information elsewhere: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else but without information linking the transaction to anyone.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.\n\n\nPrivacy model presented in the Bitcoin white paper.\n\n\nThis privacy model has obvious weaknesses: accidental information leaks, which always occur in digital contexts, and voluntary disclosure of the user’s identity by their exchange counterpart. Therefore, no one can claim to engage in completely secret activity that entirely escapes surveillance. This is why methods exist to limit the impact of these revelations to restore one’s privacy confidently.\nThe first measure is the one-time use of addresses. It involves generating a new private key and a new address for each incoming or outgoing payment. The benefit of this practice is to reduce the impact of identity linkage on overall privacy: as long as the address is not linked to others through on-chain activity (such as co-spending), the information leak is limited to that address alone. This good practice, mentioned in the white paper17, is now implemented in all good wallets.\n17 “As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.Beyond prevention, there are also methods to correct mistakes. The best-known of these is coin mixing, which involves combining one’s UTXOs with those of other users to break the deterministic links between coins and their owners’ identities.\nCoin mixing was originally handled by centralized mixing services, known as mixers or tumblers, which received users’ bitcoins, merged them, and sent common bitcoins back to them after a certain time, preferably in the form of multiple transactions. The first mixer of this type was BitLaundry, a platform launched in September 2010 by Peter Vessenes. These services obscured the provenance of bitcoins for an external observer but not for their operators, who could also seize the bitcoins in passing, posing a dual risk.\nA technique for performing this type of mixing without relying on an intermediary was developed later: CoinJoin, formally described in August 2013 by Gregory Maxwell18. This method involves involving coins in a collaborative joint transaction that breaks the correspondence between inputs and some outputs. The typical transaction envisioned is one where several users each sign an input, the same number of outputs have equal amounts, and the remaining outputs form the change outputs. In this case, as illustrated in Figure 12.7, the change outputs are still linked to the inputs, unlike the primary outputs which are indistinguishable from each other.\n18 Gregory Maxwell, CoinJoin: Bitcoin privacy for the real world, August 22, 2013, 02:32:31 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.msg2983902#msg2983902.\n\n\nExample of a CoinJoin transaction with 5 users.\n\n\nThese mixes rely on the notion of an “anonymity set,” which measures the difficulty of linking an input to an output at a given time. We can thus obtain a forward-looking score, which is the number of possible output coins to which an input coin may correspond. In our example illustrated in Figure 12.7, the forward-looking score of the output at the time of the transaction is 5. If the coin had undergone a new mix (as done in Whirlpool), it would have had a forward-looking score of 9. Similarly, if one or more of the other coins had been included in a new mix, the score of the observed coin would have increased accordingly. We can also calculate a backward-looking score, corresponding to the number of potential input coins to which a particular output may be linked, assumed to be 5 in our simple transaction but which can be much higher if one or more coins have already been mixed multiple times19.\n19 Loïc Morel, Understanding and Using CoinJoin on Bitcoin, July 19, 2022: https://www.pandul.fr/post/comprendre-et-utiliser-le-coinjoin-sur-bitcoin.20 Adam Ficsor (nopara73), William Hill (TDevD), ZeroLink: The Bitcoin Fungibility Framework, August 14, 2017: https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/tree/32ad53927a343383534bea28fffb098af65fe62a.21 The Whirlpool mixing system and the Samourai wallet were shut down on April 24, 2024, by order of the United States Department of Justice. The co-founders of these services, Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill, were arrested the same day by authorities. — United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Founders And CEO Of Cryptocurrency Mixing Service Arrested And Charged With Money Laundering And Unlicensed Money Transmitting Offenses, April 24, 2024: https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/founders-and-ceo-cryptocurrency-mixing-service-arrested-and-charged-money-laundering. (Note from January 2025.)To manage this, the system typically uses a protocol that allows participants to connect anonymously via a coordinator without risk of information leakage or fund theft. The most well-known is ZeroLink, developed by Adam Ficsor and William Hill in August 2017, a protocol that uses David Chaum’s blind signature process20. In this sense, CoinJoin is sometimes referred to as Chaumian CoinJoin. A classic implementation of this idea has been realized by Whirlpool (Samourai Wallet21) and Wasabi 1.0. Additionally, variants (CoinShuffle, CoinShuffle++, CashShuffle, CashFusion) have been implemented on Bitcoin variants like Decred or Bitcoin Cash. More recently, the Wasabi wallet integrated Wabisabi, which allows mixing with arbitrary output values, complicating the estimation of the privacy provided but avoiding the need to manage change outputs separately.\nHowever, collaborative transactions are not limited to CoinJoin. For example, there is another method called PayJoin, allowing the merchant to perform a mix with the customer at the time of payment by involving one or more coins as inputs. This operation has the effect of misleading chain analysis by making an external observer believe that a single user has combined their inputs, masking the actual payment amount.\nReturning to our example of Alice paying 7 mBTC to Bob by combining two coins of 6 and 2 mBTC to reach a sufficient input amount. In this case, as shown in Figure 12.8, the application of PayJoin involves the merchant including one or more of their own coins as inputs, increasing the amount sent to the destination output accordingly, for example, 7 mBTC.\n\n\n\nExample of a PayJoin transaction.\n\n\nThis technique was conceptualized in 2018 in several independent ways, notably through the Pay-to-EndPoint (P2EP) payment protocol and Samourai Wallet’s Stowaway transactions. Their implementation occurred in 2019 for Stowaway transactions and in 2020 for P2EP.\nFinally, another method aligning with the logic of coin mixing is Coinswap, a process developed by Chris Belcher that allows two or more users to exchange their coins without needing to trust each other and without this operation leaving a particular trace on the chain22. However, this technique has an additional drawback in that one party inherits the entire history of the other party’s coin and must assume any potential responsibility.\n22 Chris Belcher, Design for a CoinSwap Implementation for Massively Improving Bitcoin Privacy and Fungibility, May 25, 2020: https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/9144bd57a91c194e332fb5ca371d0964.",

    "section": "Other Privacy Techniques",
    "text": "Other Privacy Techniques\nBeyond simple coin mixing to obfuscate paths an external observer might follow, there are several techniques to enhance Bitcoin’s privacy. These often require modifying the base protocol and represent trade-offs, which is why they are not necessarily implemented.\nThese techniques were developed in the years following Bitcoin’s emergence, notably on the Bitcointalk forum. Not being a cryptography academic, Satoshi Nakamoto primarily focused on the system’s robustness when he designed it and did not seek to include advanced techniques. However, he was open to any proposals that would make “a much better, easier, and more convenient implementation of Bitcoin23.”\n23 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Not a suggestion, August 11, 2010, 00:14:22 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=770.msg8637#msg8637.The first technique in this category is the ring signature process, formalized in 2001 by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Yael Tauman. It is based on the group signature process introduced by David Chaum and Eugène van Heyst in 1991, which allowed any member of a group to sign a message on behalf of the group without an external verifier being able to identify the member, but relied on a central administrator. The ring signature innovated by not requiring an administrator, setup procedure, coordination, and not allowing a member to revoke their anonymity.\nRegarding cryptocurrency, the principle is as follows: for each input coin of the transaction, the signer gathers several other coins available on the chain (called decoy outputs), uses their public keys, and signs with their private key. They also provide a key image corresponding to the coin, written on the chain, which ensures that the same coin is not spent twice. The more outputs involved in the ring, the larger the anonymity set. The trade-off is that using transaction outputs as decoys forces nodes to retain the set of these outputs since it is impossible to know which one was actually spent.\nThe second technique is stealth addresses, described in 2011 by Nicolas van Saberhagen and formalized in 2014 by Peter Todd for Bitcoin24. It essentially uses the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme (ECDH) to generate one-use receiving addresses.\n24 Nicolas van Saberhagen (ByteCoin), Untraceable transactions which can contain a secure message are inevitable, April 17, 2011, 02:34:24 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5965.msg87757#msg87757; Peter Todd, [Bitcoin-development] Stealth Addresses, January 6, 2014, 12:03:38 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2014-January/004020.html.25 In mathematical terms, if we denote (r) and (R) as the transaction ephemeral keys, (v) and (V) as the view keys, and (k) and (K) as the spend keys, then the meta-address is (M = (K, V)), the shared secret is…The basic operation is as follows. The recipient generates a private key and derives a public key they transmit as a meta-address. The sender generates an ephemeral private key, called the transaction private key, and calculates the corresponding public key. They can compute a shared secret from their private key and the other’s public key (ECDH). The sender uses this secret and the recipient’s public key to construct a one-use address and send funds to it, which only the recipient can spend, provided they know the transaction public key (which can be stored in a NULLDATA output). Instead of using a single key pair, the recipient can also use two so that they have separate roles: view keys and spend keys. The view private key is the only non-public element involved in constructing the address on the recipient’s side and serves to identify outputs corresponding to the address in question. The spend private key is, as the name clearly indicates, used to spend the funds25.\nIf implemented externally to the protocol, this method’s drawback is the need to scan the entire blockchain to know if one has received a payment. To avoid this burden, BIP-47 was proposed.\nBIP-47 thus formalizes another method akin to stealth addresses, more complex, which is reusable payment codes, implemented as PayNyms in Samourai and Sparrow wallets. In this process, the payment codes of two participants allow deriving receiving addresses through key derivation. This implies they must know each other’s payment codes, and at least one of these codes must remain secret. The recipient’s payment code is generally public, so the sender’s must be hidden. The sender transmits it encrypted in the form of a notification transaction sent to the recipient’s address. This scheme’s major drawback is requiring a transaction (and paying the associated fee) to add a possible recipient.\nA final variant is the silent payments process, proposed in 2022 by Ruben Somsen26, which avoids the notification burden by using the public key of one of the transaction’s inputs and reduces the chain scanning burden by limiting to the UTXO set or a subset like P2TR outputs.\n26 Ruben Somsen, Silent Payments, March 13, 2022: https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8.27 Nicolas van Saberhagen, CryptoNote v2.0, October 17, 2013: http://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf; archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20140529235502/http://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf.The ring signature technique and stealth address process were combined in 2013 in the CryptoNote cryptocurrency concept by Nicolas van Saberhagen27. In it, nodes need to retain the set of transaction outputs (since the ring signature process obscures the fact that an output has been spent), and each wallet needs to scan the set of these outputs to see if it has received a payment. Integrating stealth addresses into the protocol allows publishing the ephemeral public key directly in the transaction (making it a transaction key) and avoids the need for notification. The concept was initially implemented in the highly dubious Bytecoin in March 2014 before appearing in Monero in April of the same year, which is now its main representative, notably implementing ring signatures with 16 members.\nThe third privacy enhancement technique is Confidential Transactions, which hides the amounts involved in user exchanges and, logically, should rather be called Confidential Amounts. The process was described by Adam Back in 2013 and formalized by Gregory Maxwell in 201528. It requires each transaction output to contain a Pedersen commitment that binds the coin to the recipient’s public key without revealing it, and a range proof, which is a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) demonstrating the validity of the amount without disclosing it.\n28 Adam Back, bitcoins with homomorphic value (validatable but encrypted), October 1, 2013, 14:19:53: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=305791.msg3277431#msg3277431; Gregory Maxwell, Confidential Transactions, 2015, archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20150628230410/https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt.29 Benedikt Bünz, Jonathan Bootle, Dan Boneh, Andrew Poelstra, Pieter Wuille, Gregory Maxwell, Bulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions and More, 2018: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf.Confidential Transactions were added to Monero in 2017 thanks to the work of Shen Noether. RingCT, which hides exchanged amounts, was added to the protocol in January 2017 and made mandatory in September of the same year. It increased transaction sizes compared to standard transactions. However, since October 2018, this trade-off has been mitigated thanks to the implementation of bulletproofs, which reduced the burden of range proofs and allowed an 80% reduction in transaction sizes29.\nAnother concept using Confidential Transactions is Mimblewimble, proposed on August 1, 2016, by an anonymous person calling themselves Tom Elvis Jedusor in the IRC channel #bitcoin-wizards, where they shared a link to a descriptive text hosted on Tor30. Mimblewimble attracted the attention of some Bitcoin developers, including mathematician Andrew Poelstra, who provided a more advanced description in a paper dated October 6, 201631.\n30 Tom Elvis Jedusor, Mimblewimble, July 19, 2016, archive: https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/mimblewimble.txt.31 Andrew Poelstra, Mimblewimble, October 6, 2016: https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/mimblewimble.pdf.Mimblewimble’s contribution is to condense the transaction history by overhauling transaction structure. It relies on three cryptographic primitives: Confidential Transactions, which hide amounts; one-way aggregate signatures (OWAS), which allow combining transactions within a block; and transaction cut-through, which allows removing intermediary transaction outputs. This reduction, which modestly improves system privacy, comes at the cost of programmability, which is directly rendered impossible.\nMimblewimble was natively implemented in the Grin system developed by Ignotus Peverell starting in October 2016 and launched on January 15, 2019. Another implementation, also launched in January 2019, was the Beam network. Mimblewimble was also integrated into Litecoin on May 20, 2022, as a soft fork of an auxiliary block called MWEB for MimbleWimble via Extension Blocks.\nFinally, there are other anonymization techniques based on zero-knowledge proofs. The most well-known were popularized through two protocols released in 2013 and 2014 by Matthew Green and his students: Zerocoin and Zerocash32. The first protocol, Zerocoin, hides fund provenance. The second protocol hides provenance, destination, and amounts using zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge).\n32 Ian Miers, Christina Garman, Matthew Green, Aviel D. Rubin, “Zerocoin: Anonymous Distributed E-Cash from Bitcoin”, in 2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2013, pp. 397–411: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6547123; Eli Ben Sasson, Alessandro Chiesa, Christina Garman, Matthew Green, Ian Miers, Eran Tromer, Madars Virza, “Zerocash: Decentralized Anonymous Payments from Bitcoin”, 2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2014, pp. 459–474: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6956581.33 Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, The Design of the Ceremony, October 26, 2016: https://electriccoin.co/blog/the-design-of-the-ceremony/.Zerocoin was implemented in Zcoin in September 2016. Starting in 2019, Zcoin gradually moved away from Zerocoin by adopting the Sigma and Lelantus protocols and became Firo in 2020. Zerocash was implemented in the Zcash system in October 2016. Using zero-knowledge proofs required a trusted setup of public parameters. While Zcoin’s developers chose to use known parameters, Zcash’s decided to organize an event called “The Ceremony” to generate these parameters. This ceremony took place from October 21 to 23, 2016, bringing together six participants: Andrew Miller, Peter Van Valkenburgh, Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, Derek Hinch, Peter Todd, and notably Edward Snowden under the pseudonym John Dobbertin33. This trusted setup became unnecessary in 2022 with the integration of the Halo protocol.\nIn general, all these processes involve trade-offs in scalability (proofs are heavier than a simple signature), auditability (not seeing amounts implies having to fully trust the processes and their implementation), and programmability (programming coins opposes making them indistinct). This is why they have all been implemented in alternative versions of Bitcoin and not in its main version (BTC), whose community is inherently more conservative.",

    "text": "Simple Contracts\nThe concept of autonomous contracts1 emerged within the cypherpunk movement in the 1990s. It was introduced by Nick Szabo in 1994, who defined it as follows:\n“A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract. The general objectives of designing smart contracts are to satisfy common contractual conditions (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries2.”\nThe simplest form of an autonomous contract is value transfer, containing only one clause: the provision of a digital signature corresponding to a given public key. However, a multitude of other contracts can be implemented on Bitcoin, making it impossible to provide an exhaustive list. Here, we will describe a few examples to explain how they can be implemented. Let’s first examine specific cases such as the multisignature account, escrow arrangements, crowdfunding, and atomic swaps.",

    "text": "1 The term “contrat autonome” aiming to translate smart contract was proposed by Jacques Favier, Adli Takkal-Bataille, and Benoît Huguet in Bitcoin: Métamorphoses (pp. 105–107) in 2018.2 Nick Szabo, Smart Contracts, 1994, archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20011102030833/http://szabo.best.vwh.net:80/smart.contracts.html.\n\n\nThe Multisignature Account\nA multisignature account is a shared account between multiple entities. It is based on the multipartite signature scheme described in Chapter 12, where spending funds requires M signatures out of N participants (known as “M-of-N”). For example, spending from a 2-of-3 account requires that 2 out of 3 predetermined participants provide a valid signature, regardless of which individuals they are.\nThis type of contract is useful for joint accounts between spouses (2-of-2), facilitating corporate holdings (e.g., 3 partners out of 7), or improving the general security of bitcoin storage. Exchanges notably use this type of contract to manage their assets. As of November 2023, the world’s second-richest address was Bitfinex’s 3-of-5 multisignature address, holding over 178,000 BTC3.\n3 Bitfinex’s 3-of-5 multisignature address is bc1qgdjqv0av3q56jvd82tkdjpy7gdp9ut8tlqmgrpmv24sq90ecnvqqjwvw97.\n\nEscrow Arrangements\nAn escrow, known in English as escrow, is a method that involves a trusted third party, such as a notary, to secure a transaction between two parties who are wary of each other. Utilizing Bitcoin’s programmability can reduce the third party’s power by including a limitation in the clause concerning them. This type of contract relies on two basic technical components: multisignature schemes and timelocks.\nConsider the example of two individuals who do not know each other, Alice and Bob, wanting to conduct an online transaction: Alice is the buyer, and Bob is the seller. They both engage a trusted intermediary, Lenny, to create the escrow contract. Alice sends funds to it and waits to receive the goods. Two clauses can then be activated:\n\nAmicable settlement: The contract is unlocked by the signatures of both parties, who can choose to send the funds to Bob (successful exchange) or refund Alice (failed exchange).\nDispute resolution: After a predetermined period (e.g., 30 days), the contract can be unlocked by Lenny’s signature and that of one of the two parties; in this case, Lenny determines who is the honest party and sends the funds accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nEscrow contract.\n\n\nAs depicted in Figure 13.1, this mechanism encourages both parties to cooperate to avoid delays and prevents the third party (Lenny) from colluding with either party before the stipulated period (30 days here). Thus, reliance on trust is minimized as much as possible.\nThis type of contract was endorsed by Satoshi Nakamoto in the white paper4. Indeed, the irreversibility of transfers in Bitcoin offered little guarantee for merchants, and escrow arrangements helped mitigate the problem. This mechanism is typically involved today in peer-to-peer exchange platforms like Bisq or Hodl Hodl, even if the implementation differs from what’s presented here.\n4 “Buyers could be easily protected by routine escrow mechanisms.”—Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.\n\nCrowdfunding\nCrowdfunding involves reaching out to the general public to contribute to the support of a project, as opposed to financing through bank loans or raising funds from professional venture capitalists. It is most often an informal agreement between the project’s promoter and the public, aimed at supporting the creation of a common good that benefits everyone. In Bitcoin, this agreement can be executed through revocable payment promises that are not subject to the arbitrariness of a trusted third party.\nTechnically, this involves creating a transaction called “anyone-can-pay,” where each contributor’s signature covers only the funding output and their own input, allowing additional inputs to be added (see Figure 13.2). The resulting transaction is valid only if the total inputs reach the specified output amount, so contributors retain control of their funds until the total payment is made and can withdraw at any time.\n\n\n\nCrowdfunding transaction.\n\n\nIn the world of open-source software, this type of crowdfunding is particularly important because there’s no privilege associated with writing code that allows one to make a living by selling licenses. This is even more true in the world of cryptocurrency, which heavily depends on the proper maintenance of software implementations. This is why Mike Hearn, who was closely interested in Bitcoin’s programming capabilities, quickly adopted this possibility to deploy such “assurance contracts” allowing for community funding of ecosystem projects. He implemented the concept in his Lighthouse application, a functional version of which was released in 2015, aiming to facilitate community support for projects. With the onset of the block size war, this project was set aside by Hearn and eventually abandoned. However, the method was later adopted on Bitcoin Cash in 2020 via Flipstarter, which helped raise significant sums to fund the protocol’s software infrastructure.\n\n\nAtomic Swaps\nAn atomic swap is a secure way to exchange two cryptocurrencies operating on different blockchains without using a trusted intermediary. The term “atomic” refers to the indivisible nature (from the ancient Greek ἄτομος, átomos) of the exchange: either both parties transfer their due amounts, or nothing happens. The concept was described by Sergio Lerner and Gregory Maxwell in July 2012 on the Bitcointalk forum5.\n5 Sergio Demian Lerner, P2PTradeX: P2P Trading between cryptocurrencies, July 5, 2012, 23:49:48 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=91843.msg1011737#msg1011737; Gregory Maxwell, Re: P2PTradeX: P2P Trading between cryptocurrencies, July 6, 2012, 02:17:02 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=91843.msg1011956#msg1011956.6 To ensure the proper execution of the contract (avoid transaction replacement during confirmation wait), public keys are assigned to each of these conditions so that a signature is always required from the recipient of the funds.The atomic swap relies on the concept of a hash time-locked contract (HTLC), which is a contract with two clauses, meaning the funds can be unlocked under two conditions6:\n\nMutual agreement: The revelation of a secret that is hashed by a function and compared to the hash embedded in the contract.\nDispute resolution: Waiting for a certain predetermined lock time specified in the contract.\n\nConsider an example of an atomic swap between Alice, who has BTC, and Bob, who has LTC. Alice (maker) proposes to exchange 0.03 BTC for 10 LTC, at an exchange rate of 0.003 LTC per BTC, and Bob (taker) accepts the deal. This negotiation can occur via a public or private order book. Alice randomly chooses a secret (denoted \\(s\\)), a 32-byte number, whose cryptographic hash \\(H(s)\\) she provides to Bob. They can thus each build a contract on their side to perform the atomic swap. The process is described in Figure 13.3.\nThe first phase is the commitment phase. First, Alice constructs, signs, and broadcasts a commitment transaction sending 0.03 BTC to the atomic swap contract on the Bitcoin chain. She provides its content and address to Bob for verification. Then, she constructs and signs a refund transaction spending the funds from this contract, which she can broadcast after a predefined delay (here, 16 hours). Once Alice’s commitment transaction is confirmed, Bob does the same on his side: he creates an equivalent contract on the Litecoin chain, where he sends 10 LTC, and gives its content and address to Alice for her to ensure everything is in order. Finally, he constructs and signs a transaction that will refund him after a delay strictly less than Alice’s transaction (here, 8 hours). This difference results from the unbalanced relationship between Alice (who knows the unlocking secret) and Bob (who does not).\nOnce the commitment transactions are confirmed on their respective chains, the second phase of the atomic swap—the collection phase—can begin. Alice constructs, signs, and broadcasts a transaction that allows her to retrieve Bob’s 10 LTC. To do this, she provides the secret within the transaction, thereby revealing it to Bob. Finally, Bob can also construct, sign, and broadcast a transaction that grants him the 0.03 BTC to his account. In this way, the exchange is completed!\n\n\n\nContracts and transactions in an atomic swap.\n\n\nThis model ensures that neither participant can refund themselves before the end of Bob’s lock time (8 hours); that Alice cannot assert her refund transaction at the time of broadcasting her collection transaction; and that Bob cannot appropriate Alice’s funds until she has broadcast her transaction. These guarantees make the process logically secure, even if disruptive events can occur, such as increased confirmation times due to fee market volatility.\nThe first real atomic swap was conducted between Litecoin and Decred on September 19, 2017, by Charlie Lee and Alex Yocom-Piatt7. Today, atomic swaps are rare, and the order books of specialized platforms like AtomicDEX are sparsely populated. However, with the tightening regulations affecting the ecosystem and making centralized platforms less reliable, it’s possible they will play a major role in the future.\n7 The contract addresses on LTC and DCR were (respectively) MLp49daA411aoZ1TmGEdyLuTCE9YA6xhpc and DccPF1yt9cV8vhr97fq3umBx7RqV53MYGDY. The exchange was 1.337 LTC for 2.4066 DCR.—Decred-compatible cross-chain atomic swapping, September 20, 2017: https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/blob/master/README.md#first-mainnet-dcr-ltc-atomic-swap.",

    "section": "Payment Channels",
    "text": "Payment Channels\nA particular application of autonomous contracts in Bitcoin is the deployment of payment channels. A payment channel allows two users to make repeated bitcoin payments securely and instantly without publishing transactions on the blockchain, using previously locked funds. These channels are fundamental to the Lightning Network, built as a layer on top of the chain.\n\nPoon-Dryja Payment Channels\nAlthough the idea of a payment channel was envisioned from the early days, it only materialized with the concept developed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in their Lightning Network project8. This concept involves a bidirectional channel whose security relies on a penalty mechanism. Both participants lock funds in a 2-of-2 multisignature contract and can make payments to each other within the available liquidity. The sum of both participants’ balances is referred to as the channel capacity.\n8 Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, The Bitcoin Lightning Network DRAFT Version 0.5, February 28, 2015: https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper-DRAFT-0.5.pdf.A channel goes through three phases during its existence:\n\nOpening or setup phase: Funds are locked by the participants into an autonomous 2-of-2 multisignature contract.\nNegotiation or update phase: The distribution of funds within the channel is adjusted.\nClosing or settlement phase: Funds are distributed to the participants on-chain, usually cooperatively according to the latest state of the channel.\n\nThe initial distribution and channel updates are carried out through commitment transactions exchanged between the participants and not broadcasted to the network unless a dispute occurs, such as a non-cooperative closure. These commitment transactions are asymmetric, meaning each participant has their own version.\nSuppose Alice and Bob have a channel, as illustrated in Figure 13.4. In this case, Alice’s latest commitment transaction, which can only be finalized and broadcasted by Bob, accounts for the updated state of the channel and distributes the funds between Alice’s address and a claim contract. This claim contract contains two clauses:\n\nRecovery by Bob: After a locktime, Bob can recover the funds, distributing them according to the balances indicated in the channel.\nRecovery by Alice: Using a revocation key that is revealed later when the channel is updated again, Alice can recover the funds.\n\nIf a payment occurs from Alice to Bob, the channel update proceeds as follows. Alice constructs and signs her commitment transaction using Bob’s revocation public key, which he previously provided to her. Only Bob can finalize and broadcast this transaction. Bob responds by sending her his revocation private key, rendering Alice’s previous commitment transaction ineffective. The same process occurs symmetrically: Bob constructs and signs his commitment transaction, sends it to Alice, and she reveals her revocation private key in exchange, making Bob’s prior commitment transaction powerless9.\n9 Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Olaoluwa Osuntokun, René Pickhardt, “Payment Channels,” in Mastering the Lightning Network: A Second Layer Blockchain Protocol for Instant Bitcoin Payments, O’Reilly Media, 2022, pp. 149–184.Revealing the revocation key at each update stage enables a penalty mechanism at any time. If one of the parties broadcasts a commitment transaction corresponding to a previous state of the channel, the other can recover all the funds in the channel. For example, Alice could recover Bob’s funds if he were to broadcast a previous channel state intending to “undo” the last payment.\n\n\n\nContracts and transactions in a Poon-Dryja payment channel: case of Bob paying 2 mBTC to Alice.\n\n\nThe main drawback of this penalty mechanism is that continuous network monitoring is required to prevent theft, necessitating a full node or a well-chosen trusted third party (a “watchtower”).\nThis functioning of Poon-Dryja channels also means that any error is heavily penalized: accidentally broadcasting a prior commitment transaction leads to the other party recovering the funds. It has other drawbacks as well: it requires storing all previous channel states, forces participants to choose transaction fees in advance, and significantly complicates innovations within the Lightning Network. To improve this situation, the “Decker-Russell-Osuntokun” payment channels were conceptualized.\n\n\nDecker-Russell-Osuntokun Payment Channels\nThe Decker-Russell-Osuntokun payment channels were described by Christian Decker, Rusty Russell, and Olaoluwa Osuntokun in a white paper published in April 201810. The underlying protocol is called Eltoo, a play on “L2” (signifying layer two).\n10 Christian Decker, Rusty Russell, Olaoluwa Osuntokun, eltoo: A Simple Layer2 Protocol for Bitcoin, April 30, 2018: https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf.The functioning of Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channels is based on a chain of transactions that are not intended to be broadcast on-chain, except for the opening and closing transactions (see Figure 13.5). The principle is as follows:\n\nChannel opening: An opening transaction (\\(T_{u,0}\\)), previously backed by a settlement transaction (\\(T_{s,0}\\)) that reimburses the participants in case of a dispute.\nChannel update: Update transactions (\\(T_{u,i}\\)) that invalidate previous settlement transactions (\\(T_{s,i-1}\\)).\nChannel closing: The channel can be closed after a certain expiration delay by broadcasting the latest settlement transaction (\\(T_{s,i}\\)).\n\nIn this model, there’s no need to use revocation keys to render previous channel states unusable; the transactions themselves serve this role. Eltoo involves what’s called floating transactions, which can spend funds from any previous update transaction. This means each update transaction is floating, as is each settlement transaction, allowing omission of all previous updates. Additionally, a state number is included in each transaction to order them and prevent the broadcasting of an earlier state.\n\n\n\nOverview of the Eltoo protocol.\n\n\nAn additional transaction is added to the chain to prevent the expiration delay of settlement transactions \\(T_{s,i}\\) from being reached and them being broadcast on-chain. This transaction simply sends the funds to a regular multisignature account and is signed and broadcast after the signing of the initial update and settlement transactions (\\(T_{u,0}\\) and \\(T_{s,0}\\)). The expiration delay only begins when transaction \\(T_{u,0}\\) is broadcast.\nThis mechanism allows for a simple protocol for updating the channel, less constraining for nodes, without a penalty mechanism, and without needing to decide fees in advance. This ease of implementation could facilitate the creation of more complex contracts on Lightning, such as payment channels with three or more participants. Moreover, their implementation does not need to replace that of Poon-Dryja channels; both models can coexist within a single network of payment channels.\nFloating transactions are implemented using SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. Thus, the realization of Eltoo relies on the integration of BIP-118 into Bitcoin.",

    "section": "Inscription of Arbitrary Data",
    "text": "Inscription of Arbitrary Data\nBitcoin allows the inscription of non-financial data on the chain—that is, data not necessary for locking and unlocking funds and interpreted outside the protocol. Even with all possible restrictions, it’s impossible to prevent the inscription of such data, although it can be made more costly.\nThe main chain of Bitcoin is widely shared around the world and will be preserved by humanity, at least as a historical relic, suggesting that what is stored there will be kept for a very long time. This characteristic encourages people to include things that matter to them. It’s human nature to seek to leave traces of our passage on Earth, and writing on a supposedly immutable ledger is one way to do it.\nVarious methods of inscription exist, each with its own qualities and drawbacks. These have evolved over the years as this usage became more prevalent.\nOn one hand, arbitrary data can be written by miners within the coinbase transaction input, specifically in the unlocking script. This field is conceptually superfluous—the coinbase doesn’t refer to any existing output—and can thus be used at discretion. This is the method Satoshi Nakamoto used to inscribe the now-famous headline from the January 3, 2009, issue of The Times in the genesis block:\n“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”\nOther blocks contain notable messages. The exodus block of BCH (height 478,559) included a welcome message for Shuya Yang, the daughter of the CEO of the ViaBTC mining pool. The block preceding the third halving on BTC in 2020 (height 629,999) included the headline from a New York Times article dated April 9 announcing the Federal Reserve’s record liquidity injection of $2.3 trillion in response to the COVID-19 crisis: “NYTimes 09/Apr/2020 With $2.3T Injection, Fed’s Plan Far Exceeds 2008 Rescue.”\nThe coinbase unlocking script can be used to write other data as well. This includes the extra nonce (the criterion that helped identify Satoshi’s bitcoins). It’s also how mining pools signal themselves through this field; for example, the coinbase of block 751,005 contains the string poolin.com, indicating that it was likely validated by the Chinese pool Poolin.\nOn the other hand, users can include arbitrary data within their transactions and pay the corresponding fees. Several methods have been used for this.\nBefore 2014, these inscriptions were most often made by storing data in locking scripts, for example, using the OP_DROP stack instruction11. Another common practice was inscribing data in P2PKH-type outputs, which were then rendered unspendable. This method was extremely costly due to the transaction structure (requiring inscription in the outputs) and the need to send non-zero amounts in outputs. It was also detrimental to the system as a whole because it bloated the entire UTXO set.\n11 Transaction c0b2cf75b47d1e7f48cdb4287109ff1dd5bcf146d5f77a9e8784c0c9c0ef02ad, confirmed on December 13, 2012, contains the string TheCakeIsALie\\n in reference to the video game Portal.12 Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0 released, March 19, 2014: https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.9.0#opreturn-and-data-in-the-block-chain.After 2014, a more efficient way to store data was authorized through the standardization of the NULLDATA scheme based on the OP_RETURN instruction. This change allowed for the creation of “provably prunable outputs, to avoid data storage schemes […] that were storing arbitrary data, such as images, as forever unspendable transaction outputs, thereby bloating Bitcoin’s UTXO database12.” It also limited the wastage of funds by allowing the creation of a 0-satoshi output. This scheme quickly became the most popular way to publish information on the chain.\nFurthermore, it’s possible to store data within transaction inputs or associated witnesses when spending P2SH, P2WSH, or P2TR outputs. This writing can occur in the redeem scripts or in the unlocking elements. This method has the advantage of not overloading the entire UTXO set. For users, for inputs where SegWit applies, it has the benefit of reducing the cost of arbitrary data inscribed in the transaction by four.\nThese different methods have been used to inscribe various items on the chain, including cryptographic hashes, text, and images13.\n13 Ken Shirriff, Hidden surprises in the Bitcoin blockchain and how they are stored: Nelson Mandela, Wikileaks, photos, and Python software, February 16, 2014: https://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html.14 Hal Finney, Re: [bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1.5 released, February 27, 2009, 20:00:12 UTC, archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20131016004925/http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/bitcoin-list/?viewmonth=200902.First, one can inscribe a hash, with the inscription serving as a timestamp. This involves inscribing the hash of a file on the chain as proof of existence. This idea was put forward in February 2009 by Hal Finney in an email to the Bitcoin mailing list. He suggested that “the Bitcoin block chain would be perfect” to “prove that a certain document existed at a certain time in the past14,” a view approved by Satoshi. In essence, this practice allows one to demonstrate knowledge of information before its publication and thus indirectly claim probable authorship. This type of use has notably been implemented by the French company Woleet.\nThis possibility can also be exploited by decentralized file hosting systems like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which uses file hashes to identify them and allows their storage by a peer-to-peer network of users. It’s thus possible to associate text written on the blockchain with images or videos hosted in a decentralized manner.\nNext, one can inscribe text, usually encoded in ASCII/UTF-8. For example, the phrase “Beauty will save the world.” was inscribed on the BTC chain on August 10, 2022, in transaction 08e5ce0783ab6d5534e234136df02e0e240f76108eb6af04b8b624646b66f5eb. Inscribing texts also allows for drawing images in ASCII art. This is the case with the tribute to Len Sassaman (see Figure 13.6), who passed away in July 2011. It was inscribed on the chain by developers Dan Kaminsky and Travis Goodspeed in P2PKH outputs and notably contains a representation of former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.\n\n---BEGIN TRIBUTE---  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=     ASCII BERNANKE\n            #./BitLen            LEN \"rabbi\" SASSAMA  :'::.:::::.:::.::.:\n            :::::::::::::::::::       1980-2011       : :.: ' ' ' ' : :':\n            :::::::.::.::.:.:::  Len was our friend.  :.:     _.__    '.:\n            :.: :.'

For example, a Bitcoin logo inscribed on May 13, 2011, can be found. A tribute to Nelson Mandela along with a photo was published on December 7, 2013, a few days after his death. In 2022, the lack of standard restrictions on Taproot script size allowed for voluminous inscriptions in a much more transparent and direct way. This notably enabled the inscription of the Taproot Wizards image, which was nearly 4 MB in size (see Figure 13.7).\n\n\n\nImage (reduced) of the Taproot Wizards.\n\n\nIn general, any file format can be stored on the chain through multiple transactions: a document, a book, a video, a game, etc. However, this use is not always appropriate. Inscription requires paying fees, sometimes high, and the BTC blockchain isn’t really designed to store large amounts of data. Publishing these files on IPFS or on a local server is generally more suitable.\nNote that the Bitcoin SV community focused on data storage, considering its ledger as a “universal source of truth15.” Consequently, a significant volume of weather data, inscribed since 2019, can be found on its chain. This has made the BSV network extremely centralized in terms of both mining and commerce, which questions the primary utility of recording information on a blockchain: immutability.\n15 CoinGeek, Jerry Chan: Bitcoin’s value is as a universal source of truth, July 17, 2019: https://coingeek.com/jerry-chan-bitcoins-value-is-as-a-universal-source-of-truth-video/.",

    "section": "Metaprotocols",
    "text": "Metaprotocols\nMetaprotocols are protocols that leverage the base protocol to function. They utilize the inscription of arbitrary data on the chain to include instructions interpreted by specific software implementations. They are characterized by being more extensive than the base protocol.\nThis is not a novel idea. From Bitcoin’s early years, some individuals sought to exploit it more deeply, using it in ways beyond a simple value transfer instrument. This initial movement, aiming to add functionalities to Bitcoin in this manner, was termed “Bitcoin 2.0.” It eventually led to the development of Ethereum starting in 2013.\nThe first type of metaprotocol developed was the concept of colored coins, which involves marking coins (UTXOs) by the additional inscription of data, as illustrated in Figure 13.8. Each type of token created is linked to an identifier, which can be likened to a color, hence the name of this approach. The idea was presented in 2012 by Yoni Assia and Meni Rosenfeld16.\n16 Yoni Assia, bitcoin 2.X (aka Colored Bitcoin) – initial specs, March 27, 2012: https://yoniassia.com/coloredbitcoin/; Meni Rosenfeld, Overview of Colored Coins, December 4, 2012: https://bitcoil.co.il/BitcoinX.pdf.\n\n\nCreation and transfer of a token issued as a colored coin.\n\n\nThe implementation of this concept was carried out at the end of 2012 through the ChromaWallet. However, it only gained momentum from 2014, with the emergence of Coinprism’s Open Assets, Coin Sciences’ CoinSpark assets, and Colu’s Colored Coins. These uses have since fallen into disuse, although the procedure has been employed sporadically over the years, such as with Bisq’s BSQ token created in 2018 as the basis of its DAO. An attempt at revival was also made on Bitcoin Cash with SLP tokens, without significant success.\nBeyond colored coins, more advanced protocols existed that managed their own unit of account. These were primarily Mastercoin, later renamed Omni in March 2015, and Counterparty.\nThe first advanced metaprotocol was Mastercoin, whose white paper, titled “The Second Bitcoin Whitepaper”, was published on January 6, 2012, by J.R. Willett17. It was a protocol allowing users to create their own currencies, called “user currencies.” Mastercoin was based on a unit of account noted as MSC, which was the subject of a one-month presale in July-August 201318. It was the first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in history, raising 5,120 BTC, over $500,000 at that time.\n17 J.R. Willett, The Second Bitcoin Whitepaper, January 6, 2012, archived: https://cryptochainuni.com/wp-content/uploads/Mastercoin-2nd-Bitcoin-Whitepaper.pdf.18 All bitcoins sent to address 1EXoDusjGwvnjZUyKkxZ4UHEf77z6A5S4P were converted into MSC at a rate of 100 MSC at the beginning, decreasing over the weeks.Perhaps the greatest success of this protocol was the creation of the first stablecoin, Tether USD, initially issued under the name Realcoin in October 2014. Mastercoin/Omni was long the only way to own and transfer USDT before the token was massively issued on other chains like Ethereum and Tron.\nThe second advanced metaprotocol was Counterparty, launched in January 2014. This platform also relied on a native token, XCP, which served as its fuel and was created by burning bitcoins during its first month of existence19. Approximately 2,140 bitcoins were made unusable to give life to over 2.6 million XCP, still in circulation today. Counterparty aimed to be more flexible than Mastercoin by enabling the implementation of autonomous contracts, particularly to create tokens and host decentralized exchange platforms called “dispensers.”\n19 All bitcoins sent to address 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr between January 2 and February 3, 2014, were converted into XCP at a rate that varied between 1,000 and 1,500 XCP per BTC.20 Hal Finney, Crypto trading cards., January 17, 1993, 18:48:02 UTC: https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1993/01/msg00152.html.In particular, Counterparty was the first platform to offer the management of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This implemented an old idea, notably highlighted by Hal Finney in 1993 on the cypherpunk mailing list as “cryptographic trading cards20.” Counterparty hosted numerous such collections, like the Spells of Genesis and SaruTobi playing cards created in 2015, or the Rare Pepes issued between 2016 and 2018.\nIn 2018, the emergence of Bitcoin Cash motivated the creation of a social media platform whose data would be entirely stored on-chain, as BCH developers were more liberal in this regard. The protocol was called Memo and involved publishing short messages publicly visible under a defined profile, following other users, and liking and replying to their messages. The idea was to achieve a sort of censorship-resistant social network but suffered from the need to pay fees for each action.\nAll these protocols lost their appeal until the emergence of the Ordinals protocol, launched in January 2023. This metaprotocol allowed the creation and management of “digital artifacts,” i.e., NFTs whose full data is immutably stored on a censorship-resistant chain. Ordinals relied on an “ordinal theory” allowing for the tracking and transfer of satoshis linked to an inscription, such as text, images, or other data. In particular, Ordinals was used to emulate the ownership and transfer of fungible tokens, dubbed “BRC-20,” whose speculative success caused network congestion leading to historically high transaction fees. The success of Ordinals also inspired the creation of the STAMPS protocol, based on Counterparty for artifact tracking and storing their data in P2MS outputs.\nAll these practices sparked debates. Bitcoin was presented as a model of digital currency, and it seemed counterproductive to turn it into a data preservation protocol unrelated to bitcoin transfers. As early as December 2010, Jeff Garzik opposed using the chain for generalized storage21. Later, in 2014, similar disputes arose concerning Counterparty22. In 2023, the same discord occurred following the success of Ordinals23.\n21 Jeff Garzik, Resist the urge to use block chain for generalized storage, December 7, 2010, 22:04:54 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2129.msg27884#msg27884.22 BitMEX Research, The OP_Return Wars of 2014—Dapps Vs Bitcoin Transactions, July 12, 2022: https://blog.bitmex.com/dapps-or-only-bitcoin-transactions-the-2014-debate/.23 pourteaux, Illegitimate bitcoin transactions, January 25, 2023: https://read.pourteaux.xyz/p/illegitimate-bitcoin-transactions.These metaprotocols have two major flaws. The first is that verifying their rules depends on a small subset of network nodes. Indeed, managing such an overlay protocol requires additional resources, particularly for indexing in the case of colored coins. Consequently, few people deploy a complete implementation, significantly centralizing the protocol and making it susceptible to alteration by an adversary aiming to censor it.\nThe second flaw concerns their sometimes very high usage fees, especially if the network’s transactional capacity limit is reached. Transactions implementing these solutions are necessarily larger than normal transactions, leading to higher fees. They are therefore more easily excluded by the fee increases resulting from network congestion.\nFor these reasons, those who worked on these solutions quickly moved away from them, preferring to turn to alternative platforms like NXT and especially Ethereum. Vitalik Buterin himself was interested in colored coins and Mastercoin in 2013 before starting to build what would become Ethereum24. It’s also for these reasons that less costly solutions—overlays using the chain as a settlement mechanism rather than as a place to record all operations—are now favored for such purposes, like RGB or Taproot Assets.\n24 Yoni Assia, Vitalik Buterin, Meni Rosenfeld, Rotem Lev, Colored Coins whitepaper, 2013: http://www.ma.senac.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ColoredCoinswhitepaper-DigitalAssets.pdf; Vitalik Buterin, A Prehistory of the Ethereum Protocol, September 14, 2017: https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html.",

    "text": "Off-Chain Contracts\nCryptography allows for the deployment of contracts without them having to be inscribed on-chain. This capability was facilitated by the Schnorr-Taproot upgrade, often simply called “Taproot,” which occurred on BTC on November 14, 2021. It included two major elements: the Schnorr signature scheme and the Taproot contract programming method. These features were integrated as a soft fork within the standard P2TR scheme corresponding to SegWit’s version 1.\nThe Schnorr scheme implemented is a derivation of the authentication protocol described in 1989 by Claus-Peter Schnorr. It is an alternative to ECDSA, based on the same elliptic curve (secp256k1), and allows transactions to be signed using the same key pairs.\nCompared to ECDSA, the Schnorr signature scheme has several advantages. First, it produces smaller signatures. Second, the signatures produced are non-malleable, as the procedure doesn’t involve random numbers. Third, and most importantly, it exhibits a property of linearity, enabling functionalities like batch verification and key aggregation.\nThe Schnorr scheme is superior to ECDSA and existed in 2008, but Satoshi Nakamoto chose not to use it. This choice can be explained by the algorithm being patented in the United States until February 2008, meaning there was no standardized implementation. Bitcoin’s software used OpenSSL, which didn’t include this type of algorithm.\nThe Schnorr scheme allows the deployment of Scriptless Scripts, contracts “without script” that are executed off-chain and applied within the signatures. The concept was theorized in 2017 by Andrew Poelstra25. It is found in examples like the MuSig2 multiparty signature scheme, Adaptor Signatures, or Discreet Log Contracts.\n25 Andrew Poelstra, Using the Chain for what Chains are Good For (video), Scaling Bitcoin IV, November 5, 2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pd6xHjLbhs&t=5755s; Aaron van Wirdum, “Scriptless Scripts: How Bitcoin Can Support Smart Contracts Without Smart Contracts”, Bitcoin Magazine, November 27, 2017: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/scriptless-scripts-how-bitcoin-can-support-smart-contracts-without-smart-contracts.Moreover, the Schnorr scheme greatly facilitates the implementation of Taproot (BIP-341), which was integrated into the protocol simultaneously. Taproot (literally meaning “taproot” in English) is a method for programming autonomous contracts that anchors the clauses of a contract within a Merkle tree and hides this tree under an aggregated public key belonging to its participants. It allows the contract to be published only in case of dispute and, even then, only the executed conditions are revealed. The scripts used in Taproot employ a programming language called Tapscript (BIP-342), based on Bitcoin’s classic script language.\nTaproot relies on a hash tree called a MAST26, whose leaves are the clauses of the contract—that is, the spending conditions. During MAST execution, the concerned participants need only reveal the applied clause and provide the hashes related to the other clauses (Merkle path), as shown in Figure 13.9. The other spending conditions are thus not revealed.\n26 The acronym MAST originally stands for Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees, referring to data structures described in BIP-114. In Taproot, these aren’t truly abstract syntax trees, but the term remains used. The hash trees in Taproot can be called Merklized Alternative Script Trees by retroacronymy. See Anthony Towns, [bitcoin-dev] Safer sighashes and more granular SIGHASH_NOINPUT, November 23, 2018, 05:03:30 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-November/016500.html.\n\n\nMAST involving the clauses of a contract.\n\n\nThe implementation of such MASTs within Bitcoin had been proposed in the past, either in the form of a new SegWit version (BIP-114) or a new opcode called OP_MERKLEBRANCHVERIFY (BIP-116, BIP-117). However, Taproot constituted a superior proposal by allowing the MAST’s existence itself to remain hidden.\nIndeed, Taproot includes an integrated cooperative spending condition. The internal aggregated public key is slightly modified (tweaked) using the MAST root to account for it. The resulting key is the one recorded in the coin’s locking script, making it indistinguishable from other P2TR outputs. Similarly, the aggregated signature cannot be distinguished from a classic signature. Thus, participants can spend the funds amicably while ensuring that any dispute will lead to on-chain settlement.\nAn alternative to Taproot is RGB, a system of off-chain autonomous contracts built both on top of Bitcoin and Lightning. The name comes from the RGB standard (Red Green Blue), which is used to define a color, directly referencing colored coins, as RGB was originally conceived as “a better version of colored coins27.” However, while RGB indeed allows the issuance and management of tokens, this functionality is far from the only one.\n27 RGB FAQ, What does ‘RGB’ stand for?, December 14, 2020: https://www.rgbfaq.com/faq/what-does-rgb-stand-for.RGB is based on two technical primitives conceptualized in 2016 by developer Peter Todd: client-side validation and single-use seals. This allows the management of an independent state where double-spending is prevented by these seals. After research by Giacomo Zucco and the BHB Network, RGB is currently developed by the LNP/BP Standards Association.\nImplementing contracts off-chain is thus possible on Bitcoin, bringing two main benefits. First, it reduces fee payments by having a minimal on-chain footprint. Second, it improves the privacy of participants. This potential positions them to play a significant role in the long term.",

But it can also greatly enhance individual freedom. This modular aspect allows people who don’t know each other to exchange value in the most secure way possible or, as Tim May expressed in his Crypto Anarchist Manifesto of 1988, to “do business and negotiate contracts electronically with strangers, without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other28.”\n28 Timothy C.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The System’s Lack of Scalability\nBitcoin’s original design is based on a simple principle: obtaining and verifying all transactions to ensure there is no double spending. As Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in the white paper, “the only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions1.” Therefore, to achieve maximum security, each node must, in principle, maintain a complete version of the blockchain.\nFrom the outset, this particular functioning naturally raised the question of the system’s scalability. When Satoshi Nakamoto presented his discovery on the Metzdowd.com cryptography mailing list on October 31, 2008, the first response he received addressed this problem. This response came from former cypherpunk James A. Donald on November 2, who wrote:\n“We very, very much need such a system, but as I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size.\nFor transferable proof of work tokens to have value, they must have monetary value. To have monetary value, they must be transferred within a very large network—as, for example, a file sharing network like Bittorrent.\nTo detect and reject a double-spending event in a timely manner, one must have most past transactions of the coins involved in the transaction, which, if implemented naively, requires each peer to have most past transactions, or most past transactions that have recently occurred. If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth—each must know all transactions or a substantial fraction thereof2.”\nBy this, James A. Donald highlighted Bitcoin’s lack of scalability. For any given system, an increase in transaction volume raises the number of transactions to obtain and process. This increase makes operating a node more difficult, potentially affecting the network’s decentralization and, consequently, security. Therefore, there is always a trade-off between the system’s utility and its security—or, more precisely, between ease of transaction and ease of verification.\nThis trade-off generally manifests as a limit on transaction capacity, described by the consensus rules (explicit limit) or, more rarely, by network rules (implicit limit). The transaction capacity limit was originally defined as a maximum block size, prohibiting miners from creating blocks larger than a certain size. In the prototype, this size was implicitly defined by the maximum size of protocol transmission messages, that is, 32 MB. Then, an explicit limit of 1 megabyte (1 MB) was added by Satoshi Nakamoto in September 2010 through the constant MAX_BLOCK_SIZE, without any public announcement from him, to prevent denial-of-service attacks. This size corresponded, for a network running at full capacity, to a theoretical volume of 4.5 standard transactions per second, which in practice amounted to about 3 transactions per second.\nWith the integration of SegWit into the main version of Bitcoin in August 2017, this limitation became a weight limit of blocks. This new metric gave greater importance to the base size compared to the witness size in the calculation of the block’s measure, also modifying how miners counted to add transactions to the block. This change was an effective increase in the protocol’s transaction capacity, raising the allowed transaction volume to 8 transactions per second theoretically, and to 4.5 transactions per second in practice.\nThe existence of a transaction capacity limit inevitably creates scarcity of block space. If it is fixed, it makes the supply inherently inelastic. Thus, strong demand for block space leads, through an auction effect, to an increase in the price for inclusion—that is, transaction fees. The fee market is stimulated by this rigid limit instead of remaining at its natural level, namely the default inclusion cost for miners.\nThrough its effect on fee levels, the limit creates a utility floor—that is, a value level below which transfer and holding are not considered profitable by users. Indeed, miners are led to reject transactions that do not pay a sufficient fee rate relative to their size. Consequently, the utility of a transaction may be deemed insufficient by its author concerning the average fee level of the chain, in which case it does not occur. If someone wants to buy a coffee for $2 in BTC but the usual fees are $1, they will quickly move on. Generally, use cases requiring “low” fees are driven off the chain, as in the case of the gambling service SatoshiDICE, which had to cease its activities on BTC in 2017 following the increase in fees.\nThe transaction capacity limit has the virtue of ensuring that the cost of operating a node remains low. It thus impacts the network’s potential decentralization. Indeed, unlike mining hardware, the cost related to verification is not offset by a proportional income, so it affects everyone equally. The least equipped node operators cannot keep up, which can affect the network’s ability to decentralize effectively.\nThe influence on potential decentralization affects both mining and commerce by preventing smaller actors from engaging in these activities at their scale. The centralization of mining increases the risk of censorship, while the centralization of commerce raises the risk of protocol alteration, and thus inflation risk. This is why the transaction capacity limit plays a major role in the security model: the lower this limit, the greater the system’s potential security.\nThe transaction capacity limit is subjectively determined by merchants, based on their perception of the threat and their personal use of the chain. There is no ideal block size limit; there are only human beings calculating risk relative to a potential reward. One might attempt to establish an average to estimate a limit corresponding to a given usage, but such an estimate would be at best imperfect.\nThrough its effect on decentralization, the limit creates a utility ceiling—that is, a value level above which transfer and holding are considered too risky for the system’s effective security. Indeed, since no security is absolute, transferring and holding a certain value may no longer sufficiently benefit from the network’s protection. For example, receiving or storing the equivalent of several million dollars on the Bitcoin SV chain is, to say the least, imprudent.\nThe utility floor (induced by the limit’s negative impact on block space) and the utility ceiling (induced by the limit’s positive impact on security) have the effect of bounding a range of values outside which transfer and holding are no longer relevant3. It is the existence of this range of values that leads to the emergence of substitutes for a given system.\nThe arrival of new users and the subsequent increase in demand for block space raise the utility floor. Any scaling up of the system modifies its characteristics. Therefore, any Bitcoin system is essentially non-scalable, in the primary sense of the term. However, there are methods to circumvent this lack of scalability.",

    "text": "Improving Base Efficiency\nThe first proposal regarding scaling up was to gradually increase the block size limit to accompany the rise in activity4. This was the solution supported by Satoshi Nakamoto, as evidenced by his first reaction to James A. Donald’s response on November 3, 2008:\n4 Among the alternative versions of Bitcoin, the path of progressively increasing the block size limit was chosen by Bitcoin Cash, which plans to integrate an algorithm to manage this increase automatically. See bitcoincashautist, CHIP-2023-04: Adaptive Blocksize Limit Algorithm for Bitcoin Cash, September 2, 2023: https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/ebaa/-/blob/f4edacd134103a7e232740463a5f26379bf90f18/README.md.5 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper, November 3, 2008, 01:37:43 UTC: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014815.html.“Bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction is about 400 bytes (ECC is nice and compact). Transactions need to be broadcast twice, so let’s say 1 KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, so that’s 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100 GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVDs or about 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending two HD movies over the Internet probably won’t seem like a big deal5.”\nHowever, Satoshi’s vision was far too optimistic. On one hand, he did not see mining centralization as an existential problem, predicting from the start that the network’s computing power would rely on “server farms with specialized hardware.” On the other hand, he thought that Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) would suffice, not accounting for its unreliability and lack of confidentiality, nor its inability to exert power over determining consensus rules. Satoshi’s plan was therefore fallible, though not entirely misguided.\nOperating a node depends on a number of burdens. The main ones are hard disk storage (HDD) for the history (blockchain), flash memory storage (SSD) for the state (UTXO set), random access memory (RAM) storage for the unconfirmed transaction pool (mempool) and orphan block pool, maintaining bandwidth (usually expressed in Mbps) sufficient to receive and send blocks and transactions, and CPU computation for data verification, notably signatures. Reducing the cost of running a node thus involves reducing one of these burdens.\nEven if naive increases to the block size limit are not in themselves a scalability method, they can be offset by technical progress from software, hardware, or algorithmic optimization. Firstly, software performance (for a given set of consensus rules) can be improved, and this is indeed one of the basic tasks of the Bitcoin Core team6. Secondly, computer hardware can be made more efficient, with certain components gradually becoming less expensive (Moore’s Law7). Thirdly, the protocol itself can be improved at the algorithmic level, through the discovery and adoption of new, more efficient techniques: for example, the Schnorr signature algorithm produces more compact signatures than ECDSA (40 bytes instead of 72), or bulletproofs make the range proofs of Confidential Transactions much less voluminous.\n6 See, for example, Jameson Lopp’s article on Bitcoin Core performance evolution, in which he describes how the first synchronization on his machine has improved over the years. — Jameson Lopp, Bitcoin Core Performance Evolution, March 5, 2022: https://blog.lopp.net/bitcoin-core-performance-evolution/.7 Moore’s Law is a conjecture stated by Gordon E. Moore in 1965, which posited that the complexity of semiconductors doubled every year. This law was cited by Satoshi Nakamoto in the white paper, who wrote: “Moore’s Law predicts current growth of 1.2 GB per year, so storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, October 31, 2008.Beyond these optimizations, there is no way to increase the transaction volume of the chain without compromising the Bitcoin model. The solution is to modify the system’s behavior in such a way that it does not overly affect the security model. Several factors can thus be optimized, including the size of the chain to keep, the Initial Block Download (IBD), and the size of the UTXO set.\nFirst, one can choose to delete the oldest blocks once they have been verified. One simply keeps the chain of headers, the network state, and the most recent blocks to be able to rejoin consensus in the event of a deep reorganization. This method is called pruning.\nBut this method does not alleviate the burden of the IBD, that is, the process of downloading and verifying the blockchain up to its current height. To address this, various more or less risky techniques can be employed. The first is signature validity assumption, based on the assumevalid parameter, introduced in Bitcoin Core in 20178, which involves skipping signature verification up to a given block hash, saving a lot of time during initial synchronization. This method is not a checkpoint (it does not require the block to exist), and the risk it poses is minimal. The second technique is AssumeUTXO, proposed in 2019 by James O’Beirne and still in development9, which involves assuming valid a given UTXO set (identified by its hash) at a determined block height: the node operator downloads the UTXO snapshot from a third party and begins initial synchronization from there, deferring (or entirely ignoring) the download and verification of previous blocks. This method presents a verification defect (at least temporarily), exposing the operator to deception, but the risk is considered acceptable. There is also a third, more radical technique: UTXO commitments, which is a soft fork requiring miners to add the UTXO set hash to the block10; this commitment would allow a much more reliable source for downloading the snapshot from which to begin synchronization.\n8 Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core 0.14.0, March 8, 2017: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/08/release-0.14.0/#assumed-valid-blocks.9 James O’Beirne, AssumeUTXO Proposal, April 24, 2019: https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/2019-04-proposal/proposal.10 Mark Friedenbach, [soft fork] Block v3: miner commitments with compact proofs, March 28, 2014: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3977; Pieter Wuille, [bitcoin-dev] Rolling UTXO set hashes, May 15, 2017, 20:01:14 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014337.html.11 Cory Fields, UHS: Full-node security without maintaining a full UTXO set, May 16, 2018, 16:36:35 UTC: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-May/015967.html.12 Thaddeus Dryja, Utreexo: A dynamic hash-based accumulator optimized for the Bitcoin UTXO set, June 6, 2019: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/611.pdf.Then, beyond the IBD, there remains the problem of the UTXO set size, which is one of the most important limiting factors. The first idea to reduce this size is a proposal by Cory Fields called UHS (for UTXO Hash Set), which involves storing only the hashes of individual UTXOs11. The second idea is to use cryptographic accumulators, as Thaddeus Dryja did with his proposal named Utreexo, which involves grouping UTXOs into Merkle trees to condense the set to keep in memory, at the cost of a trade-off on bandwidth12.\nFinally, one can choose to split mining and transaction verification by separating the system’s history and state into several fragments, each supported by a (variable) part of the network. This is called sharding. This was the idea behind using a Merkle-Patricia prefix tree (also called a Merklix tree) vaguely considered by Bitcoin Cash developers, or danksharding, which could be implemented in Ethereum. However, this is a significant modification of the protocol that may never be implemented in a version of Bitcoin.\nThese proposals are compromises made at the chain level, often affecting the system in its entirety. However, it is also possible to make a different compromise at the level of individual coins, by using banks and, especially, overlays.",

    "text": "Banks and Overlays\nOther proposals generally cited as alternatives to increasing block size are solutions that avoid making all transfers on-chain by offloading smaller ones elsewhere, these being “bundled” into larger transactions. The chain is then used to settle debts, contracted analogically (legal contract) or digitally (smart contract). This involves considering the protocol as a settlement protocol.\nThe first way to do this is to reintroduce trust into the system by contracting obligations traditionally, with what we will call here banks. These banks can issue representative money by holding all the funds or offer credit by keeping only fractional reserves. Using the chain serves for settlement between banks, ensuring the transfer of funds between their clients. This is essentially the model of free banking promoted by George Selgin and Larry White in the 1990s.\nThis first conception was defended by Hal Finney, who was aware of Selgin and White’s work, as we saw in Chapter 6. On December 30, 2010, he thus praised a free banking model based on Bitcoin:\n“In fact, there is a very good reason why Bitcoin-based banks will exist and issue their own digital currency, convertible to bitcoin. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the blockchain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. […] Bitcoin-based banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of money. Different banks can have differing policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. […] I believe this will be the ultimate fate of bitcoin, to be the ‘high-powered money’ that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most bitcoin transactions will occur between banks to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as… well, as Bitcoin-based purchases are today13.”\n13 Hal Finney, Re: Bitcoin Bank, December 30, 2010, 01:38:40 UTC,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211.14 “Bitcoin can be seen as a new and emerging system of reserve currency for online transactions, in which online banks will issue tokens backed by bitcoin for their users, while keeping their reserves in bitcoins in offline storage. Every individual will be able to audit the intermediary’s holdings in real time, and systems of verification and reputation will ensure that no inflation occurs.” — Saifedean Ammous, The Bitcoin Standard, Wiley Publishing, 2018, p. 206.This vision was echoed in 2018 by Saifedean Ammous in his book, The Bitcoin Standard, in which he argued that bitcoin’s primary role was to be a reserve currency14. This thesis was later developed by others like Nik Bhatia.\nIn reality, this way of diverting chain activity has materialized with exchanges, which allowed handling the numerous buy and sell orders related to speculation. It has also manifested through casino platforms that grouped operations related to gambling. Finally, it has been implemented by custodial services like Grayscale, which offered financial institutions the possibility of including bitcoin on their balance sheets.\nHowever, this is not a scaling solution for Bitcoin. Bank processing is not censorship-resistant, nor inflation-resistant, and its generalization would ultimately lead to the total destruction of Bitcoin’s value proposition. Thus, one can reasonably assume that such a solution can only work on a small scale, for modest amounts, insofar as the state will not intervene, as in the case of Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador.\nThe second variant of this solution is to proceed not through legal contracts relying on trust but through smart contracts, aiming to manage transfers off-chain. The idea is to minimize trust to make the process viable. This was, for example, the approach behind fidelity bonds, proposed by Peter Todd in 2013, whose goal was to reduce the influence of third parties while preserving clients’ financial privacy and allowing efficient auditing of banks15.\n15 Peter Todd, Fidelity-bonded banks: decentralized, auditable, private, off-chain payments, February 23, 2023, 17:49:34 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=146307.msg1553349#msg1553349.This approach has popularized what is generally called layering, which involves offloading financial activity to open and decentralized protocols, partially preserving the chain’s properties. The idea is to condense a multitude of transfers into a small number of transactions performed on the base layer, that is, the blockchain. This terminology comes from the decomposition into layers of the Internet protocol suite, which is organized into multiple dependent layers, like TCP relying on IP.\nIn layering, the security compromise is partial (only certain bitcoins are concerned) and time-limited (these bitcoins can be recovered on-chain), as opposed to the transaction capacity increase case where it is total and persistent. It is a method consistent with the two-layer model that Nick Szabo envisioned for bit gold, with a base layer whose role was to guarantee the unforgeable scarcity of money, and an upper layer that allowed effective payments.\nThere is thus a diversity of proposals enabling this layering by making a more or less significant compromise. The main ones are sidechains, the Lightning Network, and Fedimint, which we will discuss in detail later. There are also other proposals like physical object exchange (OpenDime), the Rumple protocol, statechains, ZK-rollups, or the Ark protocol.",

This technical solution provides additional processing capacity and higher extensibility, at the price of a slightly diminished local security. In 2014, Blockstream envisioned building an entire ecosystem of sidechains to accomplish tasks impossible on the main chain, such as issuing native assets, deploying advanced smart contracts, or managing domain names.\n16 Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Miller, Andrew Poelstra, Jorge Timón, Pieter Wuille, Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains, October 22, 2014: https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf.A sidechain is a parallel blockchain that allows transferring funds from one chain to another without compromising the integrity of the moved funds. This generally involves a two-way peg allowing bitcoins to be transferred between chains without loss of value, as shown in Figure 14.1. In one direction, bitcoins are locked on the main chain and their equivalent is created on the sidechain; in the other, bitcoins are destroyed on the sidechain and their equivalent is unlocked on the main chain.\nTwo aspects differentiate a sidechain’s security model from that of the main chain: maintaining the two-way peg and the consensus mechanism. The first involves deciding who can unlock funds during a transfer from the sidechain to the main chain. Indeed, since the sidechain is intended as a complement (not an extension), the main chain’s nodes are unaware of this sidechain. Consequently, withdrawal is subject to some trust, usually placed in a federation of participants who distrust one another.\n\n\n\nSidechain: deposit, transfer, and withdrawal.\n\n\nThe second aspect concerns transaction confirmation on the sidechain, where options are more varied. The consensus can rely on merged mining, in which case the main chain’s work is used. It can be based on proof-of-stake, involving the main chain’s unit. Or it can use a federation agreeing through a classical BFT algorithm, in which case membership in this federation matters (proof-of-authority).\nThis vision materialized with the launch on BTC of two distinct sidechains in 2018. The first was RSK (also called Rootstock), launched by Sergio Lerner in January that year, focused on running a Turing-complete virtual machine close to Ethereum’s. The second was Liquid, the implementation of the Elements model developed by Blockstream, whose primary goal was to facilitate transactions between various financial actors in the sector, including exchanges. In Liquid, security relies on a federation of functionaries performing both roles: they maintain the L-BTC peg as watchmen and participate in the chain’s consensus as block signers. RSK combines merged mining and a federation of “notaries” to ensure both the anchoring of RBTC and transaction processing.\nHowever, the two sidechains have not managed to attract significant activity over the years due to associated risks. Indeed, using these chains still requires a form of trust that, although minimized, remains present. An unfortunate example of a sidechain gone wrong is the SmartBCH sidechain of Bitcoin Cash, where the company managing the largest bridge between the two chains, CoinFLEX, went bankrupt and could not reimburse users.\nTo address these drawbacks and reduce the involved trust, a more advanced protocol was developed by researcher Paul Sztorc since November 2015: Drivechain17. As its name suggests (drive chain meaning transmission chain), it is a true machine for creating and managing sidechains.\n17 Paul Sztorc, Drivechain - The Simple Two Way Peg, November 24, 2015: https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/drivechain/.Drivechain’s main feature is that the two-way peg is entrusted to miners, through hashrate escrow defined in BIP-300. During each six-month period (26,300 blocks), miners vote for the sidechain withdrawal transaction distributing funds to users who requested it. The transparency and slowness of these transactions allow all main chain merchants to audit them. Regular, faster transfers are made via atomic swaps or centralized services.\nTransaction validation on a sidechain using Drivechain can be ensured by any consensus algorithm. But the most natural is to use merged mining. That’s why the Drivechain project also includes the proposal for “blind” merged mining (BIP-301), a technique allowing main chain miners to automatically delegate sidechain validation to others in exchange for remuneration. The validator earns the difference between the sidechain’s revenue and the purchase of the “right to find a block.” This has the effect of not obliging miners to manage sidechains while still receiving part of their revenue.\nDrivechain is a clever concept that would fully realize Blockstream’s 2014 vision. However, it has a major drawback: the security model of its two-way peg. It relies on the potential recourse to a soft fork carried out by merchants to correct a fraudulent withdrawal transaction, which could, for example, be the doing of malicious miners seeking to steal the escrowed funds. It thus depends on merchants’ propensity to monitor the sidechain’s activity on one hand, and to proceed with a protocol modification to freeze the incriminated transaction on the other. This is why the proposal is, even today in 2023, hotly disputed.",

    "section": "The Lightning Network",
    "text": "The Lightning Network\nThe Lightning Network is a concept of a network of bidirectional payment channels. It was first presented on February 23, 2015, by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja during a Bitcoin developers’ seminar in San Francisco18. At the time, competing proposals based on similar ideas existed, such as Amiko Pay (conceptualized by Corné Plooy), Impulse (developed by Jeff Garzik for Bitpay), and Ström (imagined by the startup Strawpay), but Lightning quickly became dominant. In 2023, it was the favored solution by BTC users to perform more transfers, so much so that the acronym LNP/BP emerged to designate all protocols involved in layering (akin to TCP/IP for the Internet).\n18 Taariq Lewis, SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar: Scaling Bitcoin to Billions of Transactions Per Day, March 5, 2015: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zVzw912wPo.The Lightning Network infrastructure relies on payment channels opened and closed between participants. A payment channel is, as described in Chapter 13, a set of smart contracts that allows two people to make repeated payments safely and instantly from previously locked liquidity. The use of a channel is therefore limited by its capacity, that is, the sum of both actors’ balances.\nThe principle of the Lightning Network is to route payments through these channels via HTLCs, which are more complex commitment contracts allowing the involved channels to be updated19. A payment transits over the network with minimal fees that go to the nodes relaying it. The Lightning Network is thus akin to an abacus, where the rods are channels and the beads are satoshis moving from one side to the other of the channels, as shown in Figure 14.2.\n19 In practice, these HTLCs are often also used to update the channels directly, to simplify implementation and improve privacy. — See Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Olaoluwa Osuntokun, René Pickhardt, “Routing on a Network of Payment Channels,” in Mastering the Lightning Network: A Second Layer Blockchain Protocol for Instant Bitcoin Payments, O’Reilly Media, 2022, pp. 185–207.\n\n\nPayment of 3 mBTC on the Lightning Network.\n\n\nThis functioning offers the possibility of making almost instantaneous and cheap payments. It allows more bitcoin transfers without making more transactions on-chain and without explicitly delegating fund management to a third party. Moreover, the model retains all of Bitcoin’s programmability and opens up possibilities for monetary use on the Internet.\nHowever, Lightning’s benefits should be tempered because it is not without flaws. First, it inherits drawbacks related to the payment channel model where, in the case of the Poon-Dryja protocol, an error can lead to loss of funds. Then, constraints related to capacity and routing necessarily create a tendency toward centralization, notably through the emergence of so-called Lightning Service Providers, which could lead to censorship. Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, privacy on Lightning is weak, as payments are made between identified public keys and transit through intermediaries. Finally, the network is subject to the fee level on the main chain, necessary for contract settlement, which limits the additional transaction capacity provided.\nThe Lightning Network is therefore suitable for handling everyday payments and micropayments that do not necessarily require the confidentiality and censorship resistance offered by the blockchain, using well-funded channels that are regularly replenished. It was implemented from January 2018, mainly as an overlay on BTC, and has grown considerably since, both technically and economically. Three software implementations were maintained by three different entities (lnd by Lightning Labs, c-lightning by Blockstream, eclair by ACINQ), and a system of technical standards (called Bases of Lightning Technology or BOLT) eventually emerged. Economically, the network met with some success by attracting capital, and in November 2023, a total capacity of 5,400 BTC, equivalent to about 200 million dollars, was reserved to provide liquidity for payments.",

    "text": "Fedimint Chaumian Banks\nAnother proposal is Fedimint20, a protocol for custody and confidential exchange of bitcoins in a community context. Technically, it involves entrusting bitcoin custody to a federation and exchanging Chaumian tokens (eCash) issued by that federation. This functioning explains the protocol’s name, which is an approximate abbreviation of Federated Chaumian Mint.\n20 The functioning of Fedimint is described in the documentation on the website: https://fedimint.org/docs/intro.Fedimint was envisioned by cypherpunk Eric Sirion during 2021 and implemented in minimal form under the name MiniMint. Sirion was doubly inspired by attempts to apply eCash as a Bitcoin overlay like SCRIT and by community approaches such as Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador. The first transaction of a Fedimint federation took place on September 28, 2022, during the Hackers Congress at Paralelni Polis.\nThe first component of Fedimint is the Chaumian bank managed by the federation. It uses David Chaum’s blind signature process to issue certificates backed by a certain amount of satoshis, which can be redeemed at any time on-chain or on the Lightning Network. This component provides partial financial privacy to participants: the bank is unaware of exchanges made by clients, but its role in preventing double-spending requires it to see merchants’ revenues21.\n21 The technical functioning of Chaumian systems was described in the section “eCash: Chaumian Cash” of Chapter 6.The idea of using eCash as a Bitcoin overlay is not new. It was proposed and implemented for the first time on August 17, 2010, by an individual operating under the pseudonym fellowtraveller on the Bitcoin forum in the form of his project Open Transactions. The project never took hold, as the need was not felt and the system was probably too complex. However, the idea timidly resurfaced during the scalability debate with the proposal of “bearer blind certificates” by Theymos (administrator of the r/Bitcoin subreddit and the Bitcointalk forum) in December 2016. It was also taken up in 2019 by Frank Braun and Jonathan Logan (co-hosts of the Cypherpunk Bitstream podcast) through SCRIT, a federated Chaumian system project whose name is the acronym for Secure, Confidential, Reliable, Instant Transactions. The latest project to implement a centralized Chaumian system is Cashu, a protocol developed in 2022 by developer callebtc, allowing the creation and exchange of bitcoin certificates on top of Lightning and new tokens.\nFedimint’s interest, just like its predecessor SCRIT, is to decentralize bitcoin custody. To do this, it combines the Chaumian system with a so-called “community” approach, consisting of deploying a bank managed by trusted members of a local community.\nThis approach was illustrated by the Bitcoin Beach experiment, a sustainable economic development project around El Zonte beach in El Salvador. A community bank emerged in 2020 and has since allowed locals to exchange bitcoins safely and reliably, via the Bitcoin Beach Wallet (now Blink) developed by Galoy. This experience inspired the adoption of legal tender at the national level in September 2021.\nThe second component of Fedimint is therefore a federation, similar to the federations of sidechains like Liquid or RSK, but composed of trusted individuals with the technical capabilities necessary to operate a node. These federation members, called guardians, are responsible for setting up the infrastructure and are in charge of storing users’ funds and ensuring the proper functioning of the Chaumian bank. They coordinate using a classical consensus algorithm (called HBBFT), which, like all such algorithms, requires at least 66% honest actors to function.\nUsing this federation represents an obvious technical compromise between full ownership of funds and their delegation to a single actor. This compromise brings major advantages in terms of transaction processing fees and ease of use but also entails significant risks. These are custody risk (the federation can steal or lose funds), fraudulent issuance risk (it can issue more certificates than it has bitcoins), censorship risk (it can refuse to validate a transaction), and regulatory risk (the federation can be seized and shut down by state decision).\nAll this means that Fedimint cannot be conceived as a scalability solution but as a proposal to replace custodial applications. Fedimint’s goal is to improve bitcoin custody by decentralizing it and increasing the confidentiality of internal exchanges. Its local character should allow it to escape financial regulations and thus avoid the fate reserved for traditional banks.",

    "section": "Scaling Through Substitution",
    "text": "Scaling Through Substitution\nLayering is a correct way to increase the economic volume related to a given chain without overly affecting its primary characteristics. Nevertheless, this approach also has limits: not only do the various overlays have their own flaws, but they ultimately rely on settlements made on the blockchain, whose capacity is limited. Consequently, the utility floor is not eliminated by layering, and thus it cannot be seen as a miraculous way to handle an infinite number of transactions.\nThe range of values served by a given cryptomonetary system results in demand for substitution systems better able to handle transfers outside this range. A system with a high fee level leaves the way open for using a less secure but cheaper system, allowing the processing of smaller transactions. Conversely, a system with low security level favors the emergence of a more expensive but also more secure system, enabling larger transfers. Therefore, there is a certain complementarity between the different implementations of Bitcoin that allow managing all transaction activity emanating from users22.\n22 Eric Voskuil, “Substitution Principle,” in Cryptoeconomics: Fundamental Principles of Bitcoin, Amazon KDP, 2022, pp. 315–316.Throughout history, such complementarity has manifested through the use of several precious metals as monetary base. Gold could not cover all value ranges: it was suitable for transferring large sums, for which it was selected as the world’s reserve currency, but not for exchanging small change. To fulfill this latter complementary role, silver, and other less precious metals like copper, were used. Silver, a word still used today in French as a synonym for money, was the currency of everyday life, while gold was mainly used for more expensive settlements.\nThis bimetallic (or even trimetallic) aspect of money persisted for centuries, from the High Antiquity to the 19th century. It was recognized by public authorities who defined their currency as a weight in gold or silver, and minted gold and silver coins by decreeing an exchange rate according to the gold-silver market ratio. Moreover, we observe that this gold-silver ratio was relatively stable throughout history, varying between 10 and 18, confirming silver’s monetary role alongside gold.\nHowever, with the emergence of the gold standard and the disappearance of bimetallism at the end of the 19th century, silver gradually lost its monetary role to be replaced by paper money, initially backed by gold, much more convenient for exchanges. The ratio consequently increased from 15.5 in 1870 to 80 today, corresponding to a loss of silver’s value of over 80% relative to gold.\nThe analogy with precious metals is enlightening. Since the main version of Bitcoin (BTC) is not suitable for processing smaller value transfers, it follows that these potential transfers are carried out using a substitute currency (cryptocurrency, fiat cash, credit moved by permissive banking services, etc.) or are not processed at all. Litecoin, whose main narrative is that it would be digital silver just as Bitcoin is digital gold, perfectly meets this demand. It was thus presented from its launch as a “lighter version of Bitcoin” aiming to be “to silver what Bitcoin is to gold23.” This designation stems not so much from the fact that there are four times as many litecoins as bitcoins, which has no impact on the system, but rather from the fact that LTC’s maximum transaction capacity is four times greater, which reduces the system’s potential security. This analysis also applies to Bitcoin Cash on an even larger scale.\n23 Charlie Lee, Re: [ANN] Litecoin - a lite version of Bitcoin. Be ready when it launches!, October 9, 2011, 06:14:28 UTC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47417.msg564414#msg564414.In this view, alternative implementations of Bitcoin would serve to process all transactions, at the price of necessary transfers between chains. These would be ensured by centralized exchange services or by atomic swap systems based on public order books. This solution, although imperfect, would be entirely natural and is indeed already practiced today.\nExtensibility is also affected by this effect. The technical cost of complex use of Bitcoin can be compensated by lower-quality substitution systems. Low-cost confidentiality can be provided by Monero and simplified programmability by Ethereum Classic, for example. As Satoshi Nakamoto very aptly observed in December 2010 regarding the relevance of BitDNS (the future Namecoin):\n“Putting all proof-of-work quorum systems into one dataset doesn’t scale. Bitcoin and BitDNS can be used separately. […] The networks need to be able to grow and die separately. Users of BitDNS might be extremely liberal about adding features that bloat the chain, since not many DNS root servers are needed, whereas Bitcoin users might get increasingly conservative about keeping the blockchain small so that it’s easy for lots of users and small devices24.”\n24 Satoshi Nakamoto, Re: BitDNS and Generalizing Bitcoin, December 10, 2010, 17:29:28: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28917#msg28917.",

    "text": "Three Types of Compromises\nBitcoin’s scalability is a complex subject. Contrary to what is sometimes claimed, a given system is hardly scalable. Its ability to scale up can only be improved through software, hardware, or algorithmic optimizations. Performance gains on the chain most often come at the price of a direct compromise, with increasing the transaction capacity limit, or an indirect one, with altering the security model.\nThis is the reason for the existence of layering, which involves offloading part of the economic transfers to open and decentralized protocols, partially preserving Bitcoin’s properties and relying on dispute settlement on the chain. In this approach, the security compromise is partial and time-limited, unlike the transaction capacity increase where it is total and persistent. Layering has developed on BTC over time through sidechains, proposed in 2014 and implemented in 2018; the Lightning Network, proposed in 2015 and deployed since 2018; and Fedimint, proposed in 2021.\nThe other alternative is scaling through substitution, which essentially involves moving less risky transactions to lower-quality substitutes, that is, less secure implementations of the Bitcoin concept. This effect truly manifested for the first time in 2017 with the initial congestion on the BTC network and the rise in demand for static smart contracts (Ethereum), which notably accompanied a decrease in the economic dominance of Bitcoin’s main version. Maximalists tend to claim that layering allows handling all relevant uses of Bitcoin, but, until proven otherwise, this is not the case.",

    "text": "The Elegance of Bitcoin\nTo begin with, it’s important to remember that Bitcoin didn’t appear out of thin air. It’s the product of technological advancements during the latter half of the 20th century, heavily reliant on personal computers, asymmetric cryptography, and the Internet. Ideologically, it draws from diverse movements such as agorism, open-source advocacy, and extropianism, all of which emphasized practical action over mere theorizing. Specifically, it evolved from the cypherpunk movement, which, starting in the early 1990s, endorsed the proactive use of cryptography to safeguard privacy and individual rights in the emerging cyberspace. Thus, the fundamental value underpinning Bitcoin is freedom.\nFurthermore, Bitcoin is the culmination of an extensive pursuit of digital currency, a quest notably championed by the cypherpunks. It owes a debt to Chaum’s eCash system, which enjoyed brief prominence in the mid-1990s before disappearing. It also takes cues from private digital currency endeavors such as Liberty Dollar, e-gold, and Liberty Reserve, all of which were halted by governments in the early 21st century. Bitcoin aligns with the lineage of decentralized currency concepts like b-money, Bit Gold, RPOW, and, to some degree, Ripple.\nSatoshi Nakamoto conceived Bitcoin in 2007, publishing its seminal white paper on October 31, 2008, before finalizing the prototype and launching the network in January 2009. Following a rocky beginning, the cryptocurrency gradually emerged from obscurity, drawing in individuals intrigued by its potential. These pioneers contributed to Bitcoin’s growth by engaging in software development, mining, and commerce. Once the project was fully launched in 2010, Satoshi gradually vanished, handing over control to his trusted collaborators. To this day, his anonymity remains intact.\nWith the founder gone, the community had to self-organize. This era saw the first conferences, initial debates about the protocol’s future, and the development of the earliest lightweight wallets. However, the decentralization of Bitcoin’s development eliminated any singular dominant perspective, leading to numerous conflicts, beginning with the P2SH controversy in 2011–2012. Four significant divides surfaced: first, financialization—the partial reintroduction of trusted third parties; second, scaling issues—deciding between increasing the blockchain’s transaction capacity or employing layer-two solutions; third, the emergence of alternative cryptocurrencies, fiercely criticized by some and welcomed by others; and fourth, institutional integration—whether to cooperate with or oppose authority. These conflicts have shaped Bitcoin into what it is today.\nBitcoin represents a new form of currency. It is a medium of exchange with distributed management, meaning it doesn’t depend on a central authority. Although its resistance to change aligns it somewhat with tangible goods, Bitcoin isn’t a commodity currency since its attributes don’t derive from intrinsic physical properties. Even though it shares the digital nature of the banking system, it’s not a ledger-based currency, as its ledger entries don’t represent claims. While it lacks significant non-monetary uses, it’s not centralized fiat money because it doesn’t depend on trust in a single actor. Ultimately, Bitcoin falls into a new category and can be described as a network currency or distributed fiat currency, meaning it disperses trust across a network of nodes operated by merchants rather than concentrating it with a single entity.\nBitcoin is a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system” enabling “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without the need for a financial institution.” It represents a digital currency concept resistant to censorship and inflation, making it challenging to obstruct transactions or create additional units. Bitcoin is a tool naturally suited to the margins, operating at the boundary of legality, and sometimes beyond. It’s a currency of dissent, employed by political activists, whistleblowers, and organizations that challenge authority. It’s a currency of freedom for censored individuals—those whose professions are considered deviant, who dare to voice dissenting opinions, or who were unfortunate enough to be born in the wrong country. It’s a black-market currency utilized by the underground economy, particularly in acts of tax resistance.\nThis role as a currency of freedom puts it at odds with the state, which inherently seeks continual expansion, particularly by tightening its grip on money. By supervising banking, the state has altered the foundation of money, shifting it from precious metals to fiat coins and bills. It could repeat this by converting physical currency into a central bank digital currency accessible to all, subject to pervasive surveillance and censorship. This predatory stance of the state underpins Bitcoin’s distributed architecture, which disperses risks among system participants, endowing it with unprecedented robustness.\nBitcoin relies on several technical components to operate effectively. The foremost is digital signatures, which secure ownership within the system. Users truly own their bitcoins by exercising exclusive control over their private keys. This mechanism grants the unique freedom of sovereignly managing digital funds but also demands responsibility concerning loss and theft—risks absent when dealing with a trusted third party.\nTo prevent double-spending, Bitcoin employs an innovative consensus algorithm that updates a chain of time-stamped transaction blocks through a proof-of-work process. Its open and robust operation sets it apart from traditional consensus algorithms previously used in distributed systems. Nakamoto’s brilliance lay in sacrificing some security (rendering it probabilistic rather than absolute) to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance. This model hinges on miners’ economic incentives—they find it more profitable to mine the chain legitimately than to attack it.\nHowever, the genius of Bitcoin’s design doesn’t stop there. It not only discourages double-spending but also combats financial censorship—a significant issue in today’s digital transactions. Censorship in Bitcoin involves mining a longer chain that omits undesirable transactions. Thanks to integrated transaction fees and the external nature of proof-of-work, such suppression can be effectively contested, aligning with the model’s resistance to censorship.\nBitcoin is an open and free concept of currency, inherently dynamic and multifaceted. Consequently, a variety of Bitcoin implementations exist, influenced by two opposing effects: network effect and substitution effect. The monetary nature of Bitcoin suggests that only a few implementations can survive, while its lack of scalability implies that multiple versions may persist.\nDetermining the protocol—or protocols—is an economic process driven by merchants’ acceptance of the currency. Merchants play the most crucial role by having the final say on consensus rules through their economic activity verified by their nodes. More broadly, the governance model is sociologically complex; merchants are influenced by other system participants like customers, holders, developers, and miners, as well as external actors such as opinion leaders, financial powers, and the state.\nResistance to inflation—or the difficulty in creating more bitcoins—emerges from the economic dynamics opposing changes to monetary policy. It doesn’t stem from a lack of community unanimity or Satoshi Nakamoto’s original establishment of the monetary policy. The emblematic 21 million limit isn’t absolute; it depends at every moment on merchants’ decisions.\nTechnically, Bitcoin is optimized for currency use, as evidenced by its unit representation model based on coins rather than accounts like Ethereum. While no advanced techniques were integrated into the prototype, Bitcoin is also designed for privacy, as preserving privacy is essential for currency fungibility and resistance to censorship.\nMoreover, Bitcoin is programmable, allowing spending conditions to be imposed on different coins. This modular aspect of transactions enables strangers to exchange value as confidentially and securely as possible. It’s also the foundation for layer-two protocols like the Lightning Network, which increase exchange capacity without compromising the base system’s security.\nAll these properties make Bitcoin a cohesive whole of rare elegance. Bitcoin is the missing piece of the puzzle for freedom on the Internet. Bitcoin represents the hope of a generation facing ever-growing state authority. Bitcoin embodies the project of a robust and sustainable alternative monetary system, explaining the tremendous momentum it enjoyed in its early years.",

    "section": "The Four Threats Facing Bitcoin",
    "text": "The Four Threats Facing Bitcoin\nAs we’ve discussed throughout this book, Bitcoin isn’t entirely shielded from adversarial attacks. In this section, we’ll outline the main threats looming over Bitcoin today. We’ll avoid technical risks, which have been addressed by more knowledgeable individuals, and focus solely on dangers arising from human behavior—specifically actions by economic actors within the system. In our view, these pose far greater concern.\nHuman threats are subtle because the attacks they enable often occur suddenly. The increase of these threats resembles a game of musical chairs, where participants naively circle chairs without monitoring them. As long as the music plays, all seems well—the adversary calmly removes chairs one by one, and the circle continues. It’s only when the music stops that problems become apparent.\nWe identify four such threats that could harm Bitcoin: centralization of economic activity, centralization of mining activity, widespread custodial holdings, and erosion of privacy. These threats aren’t entirely independent but correspond to different behaviors among actors.\nThe first threat is the centralization of economic activity, emerging through significant commerce conducted via regulated exchanges and the near-universal use of external payment processors and third-party wallet providers. This could lead, as described in Chapter 11, to protocol alteration attacks in the form of an inflationary hard fork, a tax-based soft fork, or a censorship soft fork. Such attacks might cause a chain split in one way or another and are especially damaging if the altered chain becomes dominant due to network effects. However, the attack isn’t fatal to the system since the economy can gradually rebuild on the free chain.\nThe second threat is the centralization of mining activity, evident in the geographical clustering of mining equipment, the grouping of hashers into cooperatives, and miners’ collective use of centralized relay networks. This risk could lead, as seen in Chapter 9, to transaction censorship attacks by a majority of the network’s computing power. Such an attack is likely to occur after an attempted protocol alteration on the free chain that refused the changes. It effectively paralyzes part of the activity by preventing its confirmation on the chain. The attack benefits from chain analysis to isolate problematic transactions rather than suppress all activity. However, it’s not fatal to the system, as additional mining equipment can be deployed—spurred by increased fees from censored transactions—to restore the initial situation.\nThe third threat, related to the centralization of economic activity, is the widespread custodial holding of funds by entities adhering to legal regulations. Not only is this practice individually questionable (a custodian can censor transactions, seize funds, and inflate the number of paper bitcoins they distribute), but its proliferation creates systemic risk. This threat manifests today through the growth of institutional custodians like Coinbase Custody holding a significant percentage of circulating bitcoins and the expansion of services targeting small investors. It’s more dangerous than economic centralization because a “hosted” economy cannot reform if there’s a protocol attack—the regulated custodians are the actual bitcoin owners, not their clients. This represents a persistent degradation of the system, harder to rectify than mere mining or commercial centralization.\nThe fourth, more insidious threat is the erosion of privacy, materializing through widespread surveillance (know-your-customer protocols, proof of address ownership) and, incidentally, accompanying chain analysis. Similar to custodial holding by regulated entities, complete transparency to the state is not only an individual misstep (leaving one unprotected from censorship and seizure) but also a systemic risk if it becomes widespread. Greater surveillance creates a more controllable economy, making the protocol more vulnerable. Additionally, identifying actors reduces the anonymity set benefitting everyone and diminishes the possibility of conducting secret activities. The erosion of privacy thus becomes a subtle system degradation that can only be remedied by combating identification links through good practices like coin mixing.\nThese threats depend on the actions of Bitcoin’s economic actors, especially its users. To combat them, users should be encouraged to withdraw their bitcoins to personal wallets, avoid compliance with know-your-customer protocols, make their bitcoins untraceable, and use their own nodes—individually or within communities. This is particularly relevant for new users, leading us to the topic of adoption.",

    "text": "The Two Paths of Cryptocurrency Adoption\nBitcoin is a system based on economic incentives where those who sustain it are rewarded. Miners are incentivized to confirm transactions to earn fees. Merchants are incentivized to verify consensus rules to fully benefit from Bitcoin’s value proposition. Holders are incentivized to promote Bitcoin to expand the economy and enjoy the resulting increase in purchasing power (or dollar price) of the unit of account. This economic expansion, or adoption, is thus a natural goal for those who own bitcoin.\nThere are numerous ways Bitcoin can be adopted, but two primary models stand out. The first is adoption by individuals and small businesses, representing a modest financial contribution to bitcoin’s aggregate value. The second is adoption by large corporations, brokerage firms, and financial institutions, offering a more significant gain for holders. In the early days, convincing the latter group of bitcoin’s merits was impossible, but with economic development and tailored communication, persuading them to participate has become much easier. Since this adoption was more profitable for holders, many chose the path of least resistance, filling their discourse with language aimed at regulated actors.\nHowever, this second wave of bitcoin adoption, while profitable in the short term and possessing its own merits, tends to become sterile in the long run. It creates a centralized, monitored, and even entirely custodial economy—an economy fragile and at the mercy of governmental decisions. Therefore, we can term it “bad adoption.”\nThe only adoption worth pursuing is that of a free and independent economy for which Bitcoin is inherently suited. This economy possesses characteristics that allow Bitcoin to endure. It is decentralized, distributing risks among all its members to maximize Bitcoin’s value proposition. It is disobedient, refusing any protocol modifications that would alter Bitcoin’s fundamental properties. It safeguards its privacy, aware that surveillance poses a threat even when no immediate illegal activity is involved. It is circular, minimizing reliance on state-issued money, especially in digital form, sensing that such currency is increasingly controlled. Finally, it is demanding, requiring discernment and responsibility from individuals—qualities often overlooked in our modern era.\nHowever, the constraints of this “good adoption” make it inaccessible to everyone. Not only does sovereign Bitcoin use demand a degree of responsibility, but it also presents significant drawbacks, currently including purchasing power volatility, transaction costs, lack of scalability, and discouraging regulations. Therefore, expecting everyone to adopt bitcoin as their preferred currency in the short or medium term is unrealistic. In other words, mass adoption won’t happen anytime soon, and Bitcoin use will initially remain confined to those seeking to escape the state-banking system and resist the powers that be.\nIt’s thus illusory to anticipate “hyperbitcoinization,” a rapid replacement of fiat currencies by bitcoin. As long as there exists a mass of people who blindly obey authority, state-issued money will persist. Only necessity might drive this mass to make opportunistic and temporary use of Bitcoin.",

    "text": "A Culture in the Making\nCulture encompasses the material, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual aspects that characterize societies or social groups. Every enduring human association tends to develop its own culture. The Bitcoin community, though vaguely defined, is no exception. Cultural elements emerged in Bitcoin from its inception and multiplied as the network grew, eventually giving rise to a genuine subculture.\nThis culture is inherently political, marked by animosity toward authority figures and numerous references to cypherpunks and Austrian economists. It also comprises ritualized monetary practices, hygiene recommendations (notably against dubious crypto-assets), futuristic artworks, books, and various podcasts, gatherings (monthly meetups, conferences), and regular commemorations of events that have shaped cryptocurrency history. The culture of Bitcoin—the Internet’s currency—also heavily relies on concise slogans and humorous memes, particularly suited for propagation on social media.\nCulture, especially the religious facet, influences individual actions. Since Bitcoin is a tool whose security depends on how it’s used, this cultural aspect is fundamental. For example, the phrase “not your keys, not your bitcoins,” coined by Andreas Antonopoulos, is far more convincing in encouraging people to store funds in personal wallets than any historical account of platform failures and account freezes. However, culture can also misguide behavior, ultimately harming the system.\nAs a speculative asset whose price has multiplied 30 million times over 14 years, bitcoin has attracted those eager for financial gain. It boasted absolute scarcity by design—a novelty in history—and it’s natural that this drew attention. This was one of Satoshi Nakamoto’s essential choices, as this speculative appeal partly facilitated the monetization process and introduced Bitcoin to individuals who might have otherwise ignored it.\nHowever, Bitcoin’s culture was profoundly influenced in the process. A genuine trend toward greed emerged within the community, reflected in memes and various slogans. Notably, there’s an underlying assumption that “the number must go up,” propelling the price “to the moon,” based on the notion that the world’s wealth is infinite and there are only 21 million bitcoins (\\(\\infty / 21\\mathrm{M}\\)). Consequently, individuals should “stack sats” (accumulate satoshis) and “HODL” (hold on for dear life) to benefit from a better future. This mindset is evident in representations of Bitcoin and bitcoiners, such as the bull of the bullish market or laser eyes (#LaserRayUntil100K).\nThis desire for an ever-higher price relies on the delusion of mass adoption we’ve discussed earlier. For the price to reach lofty heights, everyone must eventually possess bitcoin in some form. Since most people aren’t ready to use Bitcoin sovereignly, this adoption has been facilitated through custodians. Thus, a culture centered on financial gain led to the subtle weakening of Bitcoin by broadly accepting financial intermediaries, consenting to mass identification, and promoting Bitcoin to institutions and states.\nMass adoption isn’t a realistic goal in the short or medium term. When we extol Bitcoin’s virtues, we’re not addressing the masses per se; we’re reaching out to those who understand the issues it solves and might be interested. Therefore, it’s essential not to sanitize the message—to not lose these individuals, we must tell the truth; and while this truth can be veiled, it should never be distorted.\nBitcoin thrives on the tension between the official economy, which approves monetary control, and the counter-economy, which opposes it. Due to this tension, the cryptocurrency culture is constantly under attack, notably by mass media, central bankers, and state representatives. A staggering number of detractors, working for the adversary, tirelessly repeat their disingenuous arguments. While it’s useful to confront them to set the record straight for a doubtful audience, it’s futile to believe they’ll disappear or lose visibility. Therefore, Bitcoin needs a tradition—a cultural transmission from individual to individual—that can organically and healthily explain its principles to newcomers.\nSpecifically, Bitcoin’s message should always be a call to action, in line with preceding ideological movements like the cypherpunks. Everyone should feel encouraged to write (and read) code, deploy mining farms when possible, participate in the circular economy, hold bitcoin, and educate others on the subject, even if it doesn’t bring direct financial gain. This is also how Bitcoin prospers.\nIn any case, Bitcoin cannot be forgotten. Satoshi Nakamoto’s discovery is here to stay. It has already played a role in the fight for human freedom and will likely play an even greater role in the future. Its success will depend on the actions of those who support it. The revolution will not be centralized.",
