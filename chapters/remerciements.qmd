# Acknowledgments {#remerciements .unnumbered}

No book is ever solely the result of its author's efforts. Behind every author are those who help, fund, encourage, and inspire. The book you're holding, or viewing on a screen, is no exception. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who has assisted me in one way or another, especially the French-speaking Bitcoin community who supported this project.

First and foremost, I thank my readers for reading and sharing my articles. A creator is nothing without an audience. I am particularly grateful to JohnOnChain for his early support of my writing journey. My thanks also go to the teams behind Cryptoast and Journal du Coin, with whom I've had the pleasure of working for years.

I am grateful to those who helped launch the funding campaign in March 2022. Thank you to Lounès Ksouri for his advice about Umbrel. Thank you to Benjamin Favre for helping set up the campaign on the server. Thank you to CryptoSou for providing me with Lightning liquidity when I needed it.

I am deeply thankful to Jacques Favier, co-founder of Le Cercle du Coin and co-author of three books on Bitcoin in French, who honored me by reading the entire work and writing a superb preface.

I, of course, pay tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto for creating Bitcoin and sharing it with the world. I also extend my thanks to everyone who has helped me deepen my understanding of Bitcoin over time, especially Andreas Antonopoulos, Julia Tourianski, Eric Voskuil, and Aaron van Wirdum.

Lastly, I thank my loved ones—my family and friends—who provided essential support during these long months of writing and revision.
