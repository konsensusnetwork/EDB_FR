# The Monetary Roots {#ch:monnaie}

[]{#enotezch:3 label="enotezch:3"}

[B]{.lettrine}[i]{.smallcaps}tcoin is a protocol for transferring value that manages the issuance and exchange of a digital unit of account bearing the same name—bitcoin. As its name suggests (bitcoin combines *bit*, meaning binary digit, and *coin*, meaning currency), bitcoin is intended to be a currency. It was presented as such from its inception, as evidenced by the title of the white paper that described it as "a peer-to-peer electronic cash system." Therefore, to fully grasp Bitcoin, it's essential to understand economics and money.

In particular, bitcoin represents a new form of currency. Indeed, it is an entirely digital currency based on a decentralized network that operates without the need for a central authority—a true technical tour de force. This original model enables bitcoin to be censorship-resistant, in the sense that it's difficult to prevent a transaction from occurring, and inflation-resistant, meaning it's hard to create new units. With this dual value proposition, it offers a viable alternative to the modern monetary and banking system.

In this chapter, we aim to explore the monetary roots of Bitcoin by first explaining what money is, then describing the Austrian School of economics' perspective on it, before illustrating how bitcoin's model is unique and where its utility lies.

## What Is Money? {#quest-ce-que-la-monnaie .unnumbered}

Money is a complex subject to comprehend, and people's understanding of it is often vague and inaccurate. Yet, it is a tool used extensively in our modern societies, characterized by commercialization and the division of labor. Thus, it's crucial to grasp this concept in a nuanced and relevant way.

The tangible importance of money is reflected in the variety of terms used to refer to it in French. Firstly, the most common term for money is *argent* (silver), so much so that today one must specify when referring to the precious metal itself. Slang abounds with diverse terms: *le blé* (wheat), referencing the cereal; *l'oseille* (sorrel), originally a garden herb; *le flouze*, derived from an Arabic word meaning copper coin; *le pèze*, possibly from Breton; *le pognon*, implying money passed hand to hand; *la maille* and *le sou*, names of old coins. For its liquid form, terms like *numéraire* or *espèces* are used, or *cash*, an Anglicism stemming from the Old French *casse*, which led to *caisse* (cash register). Finally, there's the word *monnaie* itself, originating from the Latin *moneta*, derived from the name of the temple of Juno Moneta ("Juno the Advisor") where Rome's currency was minted.

Money is a generally accepted medium of exchange within a given group of people. It's a tool used in the indirect exchange of goods and services: a person *sells* goods and services for money, which then serves to *buy* other goods and services.

Money solves the problem of the double coincidence of wants that arises in a barter economy, where two people must simultaneously desire each other's goods in the desired proportion for a direct exchange to occur. For example, if a baker wants to acquire a piece of meat in exchange for some of his baguettes, he must find a butcher who wants those baguettes at that time, place, and quantity. Money acts as an intermediate good that people obtain with the intent to exchange it for something else, greatly facilitating their transactions.

What makes one good serve as money over another is its *saleability*[^129], meaning the ease with which it can be exchanged on the market whenever the holder desires, with minimal loss of value. The good serving as money must be readily obtainable without causing a shortage of money. This property is similar to the liquidity of a market, representing the ability to buy or sell goods there quickly without significantly affecting prices. In this sense, money is sometimes described as *the most liquid good* within a given economy, and terms like *liquid assets* are used to refer to physical money consisting of coins and banknotes, which can be exchanged easily and without constraint.

[^129]: The concept of saleability was described in 1892 by Austrian economist Carl Menger in his essay *On the Origin of Money*. The German term is *Absatzfähigkeit*, referring to a commodity's ability to be easily sold or to sell well. It has been translated into English as *saleability* and *marketability*. In French, it can also be translated as *vendabilité* or *échangeabilité*.

Money isn't a concept with fixed and rigid boundaries. A good can be more or less a currency depending on its level of saleability within the group where it's exchanged, allowing us to speak of degrees of moneyness or liquidity[^130]. Gold and bitcoin, for instance, have a lesser degree of moneyness than state-issued currencies in general, but that doesn't prevent them from being considered currencies in a broad sense. Gold is even globally perceived as the quintessential store of value and the historical foundation of money, which is reflected in culture and particularly in video games.

[^130]: Economist Fritz Machlup spoke of "degrees of moneyness" regarding dollar-denominated claims in the European banking system (Fritz Machlup, "*Euro-dollar creation: a mystery story*", in *Banca Nazionale del Lavoro Quarterly Review*, vol. 23, no. 94, 1970, p. 225). Similarly, Hayek wrote in *Denationalisation of Money* in 1976 (p. 93): "This also means that, although we usually assume there is a clear distinction between what is money and what is not—and legislation generally tries to establish such a demarcation—this dichotomy does not exist when we consider the properties that confer on a good the quality of money. What we observe is rather a continuum in which goods endowed with different degrees of liquidity, or whose values fluctuate independently of each other, partially overlap in the degree to which they can be used as money."

Moreover, a good's saleability can vary depending on the situation. The dollar isn't necessarily useful in Europe, where the euro is much more saleable. Gold isn't ideal for daily transactions but serves well for transferring value over time. Bitcoin is seldom used in physical commerce but more so on the Internet. Cigarettes aren't used as currency among the general population but have served that purpose in certain prisons. A good's status as money also depends on context.

The high saleability necessary for a good to be selected as money is reflected in the three classic functions of money, often cited by economists and attributed to the philosopher Aristotle. These functions are:

- **Medium of exchange**: Allows for the settlement of exchanges directly or over time (credit).
- **Store of value**: Enables the saving of wealth for future use.
- **Unit of account**: Serves as a standard means of expressing the value of other goods, in the form of prices.

In other words, money must have saleability that adapts across space, time, and scale.

From these three fundamental *functions*, we derive the essential *qualities* of money:

- **Portability**: Money must be easily transportable to be transferred from one person to another; the cost of moving it should be minimal.
- **Durability**: It should be preservable over time, not deteriorate or spoil.
- **Scarcity**: Its availability must be restricted and not subject to sudden changes.
- **Divisibility**: It should be divisible into smaller units.
- **Fungibility**: Each unit must be interchangeable with another.
- **Verifiability**: The authenticity of money must be easily and quickly verifiable (coins must be "sound and ring true").
- **Censorship resistance**: It should be difficult to prevent a transaction from occurring (this can be challenged in digital solutions).
- **Historicity**: Money should have a longstanding use (thus benefiting from the Lindy effect[^131]).

[^131]: The Lindy effect is the idea that the future life expectancy of a non-perishable entity, such as a technology or an idea, is proportional to its current age.

These qualities have been present, to varying degrees, in different forms of money that have emerged and established themselves throughout history.

## The Different Forms of Money {#les-differentes-monnaies .unnumbered}

Monies throughout history can be grouped into different categories. Five somewhat distinct forms stand out: commodity money, representative money, paper money, credit money, and digital money. Each form possesses unique qualities resulting from the evolution of monetary systems worldwide.

**Commodity money** is, as the name suggests, a commodity that comes to serve as a medium of exchange within a particular group. In the context we use here[^132], a commodity is a standardized, essential, and common product with qualities perfectly defined and known to buyers, such as a mineral material, an agricultural product, or a manufactured item. Thus, the good used as money originally has inherent utility beyond its monetary function—industrial, nutritional, or aesthetic.

[^132]: This is the sense given to the word *commodity* in English.

Throughout human history, various commodities have been used as mediums of exchange. People have used animal remnants like shells and bones, handcrafted items like cloths or knives, foodstuffs like wheat, spices, cacao beans, or salt[^133], livestock products including large cattle, and natural materials like stones or metals.

[^133]: The word "salary" comes from the Latin *salarium*, which originally referred to the "salt ration," then to the "pay to buy salt" given to Roman soldiers in antiquity: <https://www.lexilogos.com/latin/gaffiot.php?q=salarium>.

All these commodities possessed monetary qualities to varying extents, but some had significant flaws making them less suitable as mediums of exchange. Livestock had poor portability and wasn't divisible. Cereals like wheat or rice weren't very durable. The scarcity of shells could be high inland but low near coasts. Handcrafted items and jewelry varied slightly from one another, harming their fungibility.

Generally, precious metals—especially gold, silver, and copper (in the form of bronze)—were selected over time to become the global monetary base. This convergence can be explained by the fact that these three metals (with chemical symbols Au, Ag, and Cu, respectively) all belong to group 11 of the periodic table and share similar chemical properties, including great resistance to corrosion and oxidation, and high malleability. The use of multiple metals can be attributed to their imperfect portability: gold allows for transporting significant value but isn't suitable for small daily transactions, unlike silver and copper.

Precious metals could be used in their raw state, as ingots of varying sizes. However, they were especially minted into coins, upon which a trusted institution (usually a state) would inscribe its mark, certifying the weight and metal content. This inscription served, among other things, as a certificate embedded in the money, intended to facilitate exchange by eliminating the need for verification with each payment.

This certification can also be detached from the money, leading to **representative money**. Representative money consists of certificates, printed or digital, redeemable on demand for a base commodity, like gold or silver, from a trusted third party. Crucially, such money is theoretically backed by a full reserve of base money held by one or more institutions. These certificates are essentially money substitutes—legally enforceable claims on a debtor for a specified amount of base money.

The archetype of representative money is the classical gold standard system, prevalent during the Belle Époque in the Western world, where money consisted of gold coins and banknotes convertible into gold. Over time, however, convertibility was gradually abandoned, and banknotes transformed into mere fiat paper money.

**Fiat money** is money whose use value is negligible compared to its nominal value. Its initial value comes from the trust (*fiducia* in Latin) placed in other actors rather than its intrinsic properties, as with commodity money. This trust can be vested in a state, a corporation, or a community. It's based not only on the belief that the custodian won't degrade its properties (including scarcity) but also, in the state's case, on the assurance that it will enforce its use through authority, hence the term *fiat* (from Latin, meaning "let it be done"). Unlike representative money, fiat money doesn't represent a commodity or another base money—it *is* the base money.

A typical example of fiat money is **paper money**, based on a physical medium whose use value is significantly less than the nominal or face value indicated. The medium can be made of paper, cloth, or plastic (banknotes) or metal alloys composed of copper, zinc, and nickel (coins). Maintaining its value is ensured by limiting production and suppressing counterfeiting; otherwise, the money would become commodity money, and its exchange value would rapidly approach its production cost, generally lower than its nominal value.

States have experimented with this form of money multiple times throughout history, often leading to dramatic inflations, as illustrated by the Song dynasty's attempt between the 11th and 12th centuries in China or the episode of the *assignats* during the French Revolution. It's only since the 20th century and the abandonment of the gold standard that this model has become widespread.

**Credit money**, also called *scriptural money*, relates to the writing (*scriptura* in Latin) of a debt in a bank's ledger. It differs from representative money in that it doesn't oblige the custodian to hold the represented good in reserve. Banks are credit organizations, not money warehouses: when someone "deposits" funds into a bank account, they're effectively lending money to the bank, which "credits" their account accordingly (hence the adage "deposits make loans").

Like representative money, credit money is a money substitute. It must be based on a base unit of account, derived from commodity money (like gold) or fiat money (like the dollar), used to settle the debt upon maturity.

Today, credit is widely monetized in Western societies, as evidenced by modern payment methods such as checks, transfers, and bank cards. Scriptural money composes more than 90% of the broad money supply in circulation.

**Digital money** is a particular form of fiat money whose existence relies on an electronically managed ledger. It differs from scriptural money in that the ledger entry isn't a claim on a third party but *is the money itself*. The money is stored on electronic memory, hence the term *electronic money*[^134]. Due to its nature, this form of money is generally programmable, meaning spending conditions can be inscribed in the supporting computer system.

[^134]: Legally, electronic money refers to a specific type of scriptural money. Article L315-1 of the *Code monétaire et financier* defines it as "a monetary value stored in electronic form, including magnetic, representing a claim on the issuer, issued against the remittance of funds for payment transactions defined in Article L. 133-3, and accepted by a natural or legal person other than the issuer." Therefore, we prefer to use the term *digital money* here.

The first example of digital money is that managed centrally by a central bank. Along with coins and banknotes, it constitutes the monetary base, also called "central bank money" or "central money." Specifically, it comprises the monetary assets held by account holders with the central bank (i.e., commercial banks). This type of money allowed dependence on physical media—which made settlement difficult and risky—to be reduced. In the future, state digital money is expected to expand to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) available to financial institutions and possibly individuals.

The second example is **cryptocurrency**, managed in a decentralized manner by a peer-to-peer network, with bitcoin being the archetype. It's a market-based digital money in that its existence doesn't depend on state intervention (or lack thereof). This is the form of money on which this work focuses.

## The Austrian School and the Value of Money {#lecole-autrichienne-et-la-valeur-de-la-monnaie .unnumbered}

Since Bitcoin is a monetary system, understanding its functioning and implications requires knowledge of economics. While there are multiple ways to approach the subject, we'll adopt the perspective of the "Austrian" economic school, which is probably the most relevant for describing Bitcoin, as it inspired, at least indirectly, its creation and development.

The Austrian School of economics, also known as the Vienna School, is an economic thought tradition founded in Austria in the 19th century around Carl Menger. It initially developed in this Central European country with thinkers like Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Friedrich von Wieser. After World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918, it spread abroad, notably to the United States, with economists of Austrian origin like Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek (the latter receiving the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974). Subsequently, it expanded to include thinkers of various backgrounds, with main figures like Murray Rothbard, Jesús Huerta de Soto, and Hans-Hermann Hoppe.

The Austrian School is characterized by its methodological approach—*methodological individualism*—based on praxeology, the rational study of human action. This method is aprioristic (or axiomatic), relying on certain axioms related to human behavior. It begins with the individual to deduce logical consequences for the whole economy. Thus, the Austrian School opposes economic thought schools that mainly rely on observation and seek to model the economy "mathematically," such as the predominantly neo-Keynesian schools today.

Notably, the Austrian School provides a nuanced analysis of value—the interest or importance an individual places on something.

Various conceptions of the origin of value exist. Some believe value comes from land and related activities, a thesis defended by 18th-century physiocratic economists. Others postulate that value originates from labor, like Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and especially Karl Marx, whose supporters have upheld this theory since the 19th century.

The Austrian School differs by advocating a subjective conception of value. For Austrians, value isn't an objective phenomenon but depends on individual perspective. According to Carl Menger:

*"Value is not inherent in goods, it is not a property of them; it is not a thing existing by itself. It is the judgment economizing men make about the importance of the goods at their disposal for the maintenance of their lives and well-being. Hence, value does not exist outside the consciousness of men."*[^135]

[^135]: Carl Menger, *Principles of Economics*, Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2007, pp. 120–121: <https://cdn.mises.org/principles_of_economics.pdf>.

Thus, one individual might assign immense value to a good (like a painting), while another might attach none. Similarly, the value attributed can vary based on context: someone living in a desert won't view a liter of water the same way as someone in a humid region.

An individual's prior consumption can also affect the value of the same good. If someone is starving, they'll place great value on an apple; but as they become satiated, the value they assign to subsequent apples decreases. This concept is known as *marginal utility*.

Economists refer to the value an individual derives from a good as *use value*. The meaning of this term varies depending on who uses it. Often, it refers to objective use value—the relationship between an object and the effect it can produce, like the heating power of wood. But in the Austrian context, it can also refer to subjective use value, which isn't always based on an objective evaluation criterion.

Assessing the value of goods and services allows individuals to determine how to direct their production and consumption. This valuation also plays a role in commerce: an exchange occurs only if both parties assign *greater value* to the good held by the other. Thus, if a good belonging to someone else is worth more to me than four silver coins, and that person values two silver coins more than the good, an exchange at a price of three silver coins would benefit us both. This is why, in the long run, the free market *creates* wealth. The price obtained in commerce is sometimes called *exchange value*.

Even though value is subjective, this doesn't prevent people from assigning value to the same things. First, being similar, they naturally value goods that satisfy their primary physiological needs (drinking water, food, clothing, shelter, etc.). Second, they tend to mimic others' desires for non-essential items, aligning with the mimetic nature of desire, leading to fads and trends around common objects. Finally, they assign value to higher-order goods, such as tools (capital) or raw materials, used to produce the desired consumer goods.

Money is a special case in value analysis. It rests on an intersubjective phenomenon—a psychological construct within each person that strengthens as it becomes ingrained in others' minds. People acquire money because they believe they can later exchange it for other goods, reinforcing others' belief in its utility. This creates a virtuous cycle consistent with the network effect.

As a result, even though value is subjectively assessed, the value of money necessarily converges toward a common objective exchange value, known as *purchasing power*. This purchasing power can vary over time and location, influenced by natural market fluctuations and distortions caused by the state. When it decreases persistently (manifested by a general rise in prices), it's called inflation. When it increases persistently (resulting in a general price decline), it's called deflation.

Within the valuation of the good used as money, we can distinguish two mutually exclusive values: its non-monetary value—the nutritional, industrial, aesthetic, etc., utility derived by the person—and its strictly monetary value, stemming from the advantage of using the good as a medium of exchange. For commodity monies, for example, we can differentiate between intrinsic demand and monetary demand: gold's value doesn't solely come from aesthetic demand (jewelry) and industrial demand (microprocessors) but also, and primarily, from its demand as a medium of exchange, notably from central banks.

Austrian economists minimize the state's role in creating money, positing that it largely emerged from economic exchange—at least concerning its most primitive form. They oppose chartalists and proponents of modern monetary theory, who assert that money originated from state intervention and derives its value from being used to pay taxes[^136]. As Carl Menger wrote:

*"The origin of money (which must be distinguished from coins, which are merely a variety) is [...] entirely natural, and thus only under very rare circumstances the result of the state's influence. Money is neither an invention of the state nor the product of a legislative act, and the sanction of such an act by the state's authority is therefore foreign to the very concept of money."*[^137]

[^136]: Chartalism (from Latin *charta*, meaning "paper" or "ticket") is a monetary theory developed by German economist Georg Friedrich Knapp in 1905 in his work *Staatliche Theorie des Geldes*. Modern monetary theory is a form of neo-chartalism.

[^137]: Carl Menger, *Principles of Economics*, Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2007, pp. 261–262.

From this perspective, money originated from exchanges between groups of individuals who didn't trust each other but wanted to cooperate. Thus, proto-moneys (or paleo-moneys) emerged not within human tribes—whose internal functioning largely relied on gift and credit—but *between* these tribes. This could involve simple exchange of goods, conflict resolution, marriage arrangements, and payment of tributes[^138].

[^138]: Nick Szabo, *Shelling Out: The Origins of Money*, 2002; George Selgin, *The Myth of the Myth of Barter*, 2016: <https://www.alt-m.org/2016/03/15/myth-myth-barter/>.

With the gradual globalization of the planet, proto-moneys underwent selection: many disappeared in favor of those satisfying the properties of good money. Specifically, the chosen good needed to be easy to hide (censorship resistance), difficult to produce (scarcity), and its value easily estimable (verifiability). Money converged toward coins made of precious metals, most often gold and silver, preferably minted by a recognized authority. The first minted coins likely appeared in the 7th century BCE in Asia Minor under the Lydians, made of electrum—a natural alloy of gold and silver. Subsequently, numerous coins succeeded one another: the Persian daric, the Greek drachma, the Roman denarius, the Byzantine solidus (bezant), and others.

The use of coins persisted for centuries and became widespread globally. However, this usage gradually declined from the Renaissance with the emergence of banknotes, which became prevalent during the 19th century due to state actions. The transition to fiat paper money occurred in the 20th century with the total abandonment of any reference to precious metals in the monetary system in 1971. We've witnessed a genuine corruption of money, which brought some benefits but mainly allowed authorities to profit further from monetary creation through the infamous "printing press."

For proponents of liberty, it's crucial to redeem money[^139] by returning to what Austrian economists call *sound money*. Sound money is money freely chosen by the market and shielded from coercive interference. As Ludwig von Mises wrote in his *The Theory of Money and Credit* in 1912:

*"The principle of sound money has two aspects. It is positive in that it approves the market's choice of a commonly used medium of exchange. It is negative in that it obstructs the government's propensity to meddle with the monetary system."*[^140]

[^139]: Bitcoin and Bible Group, *Thank God for Bitcoin: The Creation, Corruption and Redemption of Money*, Whispering Candle, 2020.

[^140]: Ludwig von Mises, *The Theory of Money and Credit*, Yale University Press, 1953, p. 414: <https://cdn.mises.org/Theory%20of%20Money%20and%20Credit.pdf>.

Several political projects have emerged aiming to restore a global monetary system based on sound money. The first was Mises's (and Rothbard's) plan to reinstate the gold standard. For Mises, "sound money means a metallic standard," and the gold standard "makes the determination of the purchasing power of the monetary unit independent of governments and political parties."

The second project was Friedrich Hayek's, developed later, advocating for currency competition (representative or fiat) issued by private banks[^141]. This inspired the free banking model, where financial institutions could operate freely without intervention from a central bank or other authority—a model notably supported by economists Lawrence White, George Selgin, and Kevin Dowd.

[^141]: Friedrich Hayek, *Denationalisation of Money*, The Institute of Economic Affairs, 1976.

Neither of these political projects ever materialized, despite decades of events demonstrating the validity of Austrian theories. History shows that state control over money has gradually expanded to become what it is today—a control tending toward totalitarianism. However, there's an alternative—a solution not political but economic: Bitcoin.

## A New Form of Money {#une-nouvelle-forme-de-monnaie .unnumbered}

Bitcoin garners much attention because it introduces something new—not only technically but especially economically. Satoshi Nakamoto's discovery of this system in 2008 represents a significant upheaval in the monetary realm. Bitcoin constitutes an unprecedented form of money: a *sui generis* currency (to use Jacques Favier's expression), of its own kind, challenging existing classifications.

Firstly, as mentioned, it's an entirely digital currency. Bitcoin relies on a public ledger of ownership (the blockchain) that defines the currency: entries in this ledger don't correspond to claims, as with credit money, but are the money itself.

Secondly, this digital currency innovates by eliminating the need for a trusted third party. The ledger's content doesn't depend on a financial institution like a central bank but on a network of actors operating through a distributed computer network.

Thirdly, its security is assured economically: it doesn't rely on altruistic volunteerism (though that plays a role) but on the economic incentives of the actors involved. This grants the system long-term stability absent in previous private currencies.

These properties enable bitcoin to function as distributed fiat money, in that it lacks significant non-monetary uses and derives its value from trust placed in an economy of merchants rather than a third party. It can also be described as network money (from Latin *reticulum*, meaning "small net" or "network") since trust is distributed across the network of merchant nodes rather than concentrated on a central server.

Although bitcoin shares characteristics with commodity monies[^142], it isn't a commodity. Its properties emerge from an agreement among its users, not from intrinsic physical world characteristics like gold or silver. It's possible to modify the system's consensus rules, though such changes are challenging.

[^142]: "There is [...] no one acting as a central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the number of users grows. [...] In this sense, it is a system that behaves more like a precious metal."—Satoshi Nakamoto, *Re: Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency*, February 18, 2009, <https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008:Comment:9562>.

In reality, money is always an agreement regarding a mutually acceptable intermediary in trade. With commodity money, this agreement naturally converges toward a commodity already exchanged in society. With fiat money, the agreement is maintained by a state decree respected by the population. In Bitcoin's case, coordination is voluntarily achieved around specific consensus rules.

The extent of this agreement gives the currency its strength through the network effect: its utility increases superlinearly relative to the size of the economy using it. This makes it difficult for one currency to be replaced by another and also complicates altering the system's consensus rules, as we'll see in Chapter [11](#ch:determination){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:determination"} on protocol determination.

The primary advantage of commodity money isn't its intrinsic value but the unforgeable cost required for its production, preventing excessive monetary creation from destroying its purchasing power. In fiat money—whether state or private—the money's determination lies entirely in the issuer's hands, who might exploit the situation by creating more units for personal gain, especially if legally privileged.

Bitcoin is different and isn't subject to this risk: its distributed functioning spreads determination across the economy, preventing it from being subject to a third party's arbitrary decisions. This uniqueness grants it an unprecedented characteristic: absolute scarcity, resulting from a fixed quantity of units issued according to a predefined schedule. This factor has contributed to its renown: the fact that the money supply is limited to 21 million bitcoins.

Thus, "intrinsic value" isn't essential for money's quality. Bitcoin, a pure form of money valued almost exclusively for its monetary role, proves this. For commodity monies, physical properties served as safeguards against private and state interventions; in Bitcoin, the network fulfills this function.

## Bitcoin and the Regression Theorem {#bitcoin-et-le-theoreme-de-regression .unnumbered}

Some Austrian economists refuse to accept that bitcoin could have emerged without an objective use value. They reference Ludwig von Mises's regression theorem, which states that a currency's exchange value is calculated based on its previous value and must, by regression, trace back to its value as a commodity.

The core of this theorem is found in *The Theory of Money and Credit*, published in 1912, where Mises writes:

*"The theory of money's value as such can only trace the objective exchange value back to the point where it ceases to be money's value and becomes solely the value of a commodity. At that point, the theory must leave further investigation to the general theory of value, which then has no difficulty solving the problem. It's true that money's subjective valuation presupposes an existing objective exchange value, but the value that needs presupposing isn't the same as the value that needs explaining. What is presupposed is yesterday's exchange value, and it's perfectly legitimate to use it to explain today's. Money's objective exchange value established on today's market derives from yesterday's under the influence of individuals' subjective valuations in the market, just as yesterday's derived in turn from the day-before-yesterday's.

If we continually regress in this way, we must arrive at a point where we find no further component in the objective exchange value arising from valuations based on money's function as a common medium of exchange; a point where money's value is nothing other than the value of the object useful in another way than as money."*[^143]

[^143]: Ludwig von Mises, *The Theory of Money and Credit*, Yale University Press, 1953, pp. 120–121.

The theorem involves two elements: regression and initial valuation.

Regarding regression, the reasoning holds: the value assigned to money is based on its previous value, allowing us to trace back to an entirely non-monetary value. This initial value doesn't need to persist; once money is established, its valuation can rely solely on the memory of past prices.

Historically, this regression is evident. The value of our current fiat banknotes in the West can be traced back step by step to the value of banknotes as gold certificates, stemming from the value of coins, which in turn comes from gold's raw value. Gold was initially valued for ornamental and religious reasons before serving as a medium of exchange.

Regarding initial valuation, Mises's assertion is less accurate. He speaks of a "commodity" (*Ware* in German, *commodity* in English) initially valued for its "industrial" utility, a standardized and common product with defined and known qualities. Elsewhere, he explicitly opposes the Lockean theory of money's origin, which, in his words, derives "the origin of money from a general agreement attributing fictitious values to intrinsically valueless things." Mises seems to exclude the possibility of an intangible good without objective use value becoming a medium of exchange without being backed by previous money.

Yet this is precisely what happened with bitcoin, whose success serves as a clear counterexample to the regression theorem in its strictest sense. Mises's error seems rooted in his bias toward precious metals, linked to the period he was writing in—the early 20th century. Imagining a monetary system as unconventional as Bitcoin was difficult decades before the technological revolution of personal computers and the Internet. As Satoshi Nakamoto explained in August 2010:

*"I think the traditional qualifications for money were described assuming that there were so many rare items competing in the world that an item with an intrinsic value start-up advantage would surely win out over those without intrinsic value. But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, if there were only rare items without intrinsic value, I think people would still take something."*[^146]

[^146]: Satoshi Nakamoto, *Re: Bitcoin does NOT violate Mises' Regression Theorem*, August 27, 2010, 17:32:07 UTC: <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583.msg11405#msg11405>.

Despite this misconception, the regression theorem remains valid in a broader sense. For any money to serve as a medium of exchange, it must have *initially* possessed a non-monetary use value. Consequently, someone had to assign value to bitcoin "for one reason or another"[^147] before it could be used monetarily, such as to "transfer wealth over a long distance."

There was, therefore, a bootstrapping problem. Cryptographer Hal Finney, who had experimented with digital cash systems in the early 1990s, was notably aware of this. In Bitcoin's early days in January 2009, he wrote:

*"One immediate problem with any new currency is how to value it. Even ignoring the practical issue that almost no one will accept it at first, it's still hard to find a convincing argument for assigning it a non-zero value."*[^148]

But this bootstrapping eventually occurred.

## The Emergence of Bitcoin's Value {#lemergence-de-la-valeur-du-bitcoin .unnumbered}

According to the regression theorem, bitcoin must have possessed a non-monetary use value (objective or subjective) before being valued as a medium of exchange. Over the years, various initial valuation hypotheses have been proposed to explain the emergence of bitcoin's market value. Let's examine the main ones, starting with the least plausible and concluding with the most likely.

Firstly, an unfortunately common hypothesis is that bitcoin's value derives from the energy used in its production. This idea originates from NewLibertyStandard's estimation, who, starting in October 2009, bought and sold bitcoins at a rate based on his personal production's energy cost. Essentially, this is a revisited version of the Marxist labor theory of value. Satoshi Nakamoto criticized this explanation in February 2010, stating that production cost is a consequence of price, not a cause:

*"In the absence of a market to establish a price, NewLibertyStandard's estimation based on production cost is a good guess and a useful service (thank you). The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost. If the price is below cost, production slows down. If the price is above cost, profit can be made by producing and selling more. At the same time, increased production would raise the difficulty, pushing the production cost toward the price."*[^149]

[^149]: Satoshi Nakamoto, *Re: Current Bitcoin economic model is unsustainable*, February 21, 2010, 05:44:24 UTC: <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.msg415#msg415>. He reiterated this objection in July 2010: "It [the currency] isn't stable relative to energy. This has been discussed. It's not tied to energy cost. NLS's estimation based on energy was a good starting point, but market forces will increasingly dominate." (Satoshi Nakamoto, *Re: Slashdot Submission for 1.0*, July 5, 2010, 21:31:14 UTC: <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=234.msg1976#msg1976>)

Some have suggested that value comes from bitcoin being exchanged for dollars, proposing that regression transmits through this conversion. However, exchanges with dollars have always been at variable rates, determined by supply and demand, without any entity guaranteeing a fixed rate. Therefore, this hypothesis isn't valid.

Another initial valuation hypothesis cites bitcoin's ability to be a payment system. But this argument is circular: no one can pay in bitcoins if it has no value to anyone. Moreover, even if the network had facilitated dollar or euro transfers, such payments wouldn't have been secure due to Bitcoin's economically based mining security, which we'll describe in Chapter [8](#ch:confirmation){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:confirmation"}.

A related hypothesis is that individuals valued bitcoin for its ability to serve as a timestamping service—associating a date and time with specific information. Bitcoin allows arbitrary data to be written on its blockchain, guaranteeing their notarial authenticity; for example, one can publish a document's hash in a transaction to prove its existence prior to the transaction's confirmation date. However, for this anchoring to be useful, the ledger must be difficult to modify. Since Bitcoin's security is essentially economic, this usage couldn't have enabled initial valuation. Moreover, it didn't happen this way: aside from the message in the first block (intended to prevent backdating the launch), no arbitrary data was inscribed on the chain before 2011.

To find reasons for bitcoin's initial valuation, we must look to individuals' strictly subjective preferences, not hypothetical objective use values. Examining Bitcoin's early history, we observe two main reasons behind its valuation: cultural motivation and speculation.

The first reason is cultural motivation. According to this hypothesis, bitcoin was a collectible representing the principles its enthusiasts believed in. This drove people to acquire it even without material advantage. This aligns somewhat with valuing it as a payment system but with a distinction: individuals didn't value bitcoin because it was immediately a good payment system but because they wanted the project to succeed.

In this vein, economist Konrad S. Graf spoke in 2013 of "components of direct use value," which are "psychological or sociological, relating to factors such as inherent geek appeal, professional challenge to experts, curiosity, and signaling belonging."[^150] Similarly, Ross Ulbricht, creator of the Silk Road marketplace, wrote in a 2019 essay:

*"It's as if by magic that bitcoin could somehow come from nothing and, without prior value or authoritarian decree, become money. But Bitcoin didn't emerge from a vacuum. It was the solution to a problem cryptographers had grappled with for years: How to create decentralized digital money that can't be counterfeited and is trustworthy.

This problem persisted so long that some left its resolution to others and instead dreamed of what our future would be if decentralized digital currency became a reality. They dreamed of a future where the world's economic power would be accessible to all, where value could be transferred anywhere with a button press. They dreamed of prosperity and freedom dependent solely on the mathematics of strong encryption."*[^151]

[^150]: Konrad S. Graf, *Bitcoins, the regression theorem, and that curious but unthreatening empirical world*, February 27, 2013: <https://www.konradsgraf.com/blog1/2013/2/27/in-depth-bitcoins-the-regression-theorem-and-that-curious-bu.html>.

[^151]: Ross Ulbricht, *Bitcoin Equals Freedom*, September 25, 2019: <https://rossulbricht.medium.com/bitcoin-equals-freedom-6c33986b4852>.

Thus, the dream of free digital money partly motivated bitcoin's initial valuation. From the outset, the goal was to create money, and bitcoin was valued for this potential.

Bitcoin aligned notably with the American libertarian ideal, represented at the time by politician Ron Paul, who advocated to "End the Fed" and sought the Republican nomination for the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. The cypherpunks, mostly from the United States, largely shared this ideology. Satoshi himself acknowledged this proximity, stating in November 2008 that Bitcoin's concept was "very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint."[^152] Naturally, the first to assign value to bitcoin were these libertarians, like Martti Malmi, NewLibertyStandard, or later, Ross Ulbricht.

[^152]: Satoshi Nakamoto, *Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper*, November 14, 2008, 18:55:35 UTC: <https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014853.html>.

The second reason is the speculative value arising from bitcoin's potential as money. Bitcoin's promise made it prudent to invest in it. Specifically, bitcoin was expected to become over time a currency with a fixed quantity (21 million), possessing absolute scarcity.

This unique characteristic captured imaginations. With a limited number of bitcoins and increasing monetary utility, their unit price would theoretically surge. This expectation fueled the speculative waves throughout the cryptocurrency's history.

This idea appeared in January 2009 when Hal Finney estimated that bitcoin's unit price could reach $10 million:

*"As a fun thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful and becomes the dominant payment system used worldwide. Then the total value of the currency should equal the total value of all wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, this would give each coin a value of about $10 million."*[^153]

Though this estimation was debatable (money isn't supposed to represent all the world's wealth), it carried the notion that everyone could benefit from price appreciation.

Subsequently, Satoshi himself used this logic to attract potential users. On January 16, he stated that "it might make sense to get some just in case it catches on" and that "if enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."[^154] On February 18, he wrote that "as the number of users grows, the value per coin increases," which could "attract more users," creating a "positive feedback loop" for the system.[^155]

Thus, these two reasons—cultural and speculative—primarily contributed to bitcoin's initial valuation. Early miners used their computers and expended energy because Bitcoin's idea aligned with their moral values and they "felt they were making a beneficial contribution to the world,"[^156] or because they foresaw potential profit.[^157] Those willing to accept bitcoins in exchange for other things did so for the same reasons. NewLibertyStandard, the first to exchange dollars for bitcoins in October 2009, was convinced that Bitcoin was "an economic revolution" and "the standard of digital money."[^158]

As an anonymous internet user wrote in 2012, "the early Bitcoin enthusiasts were the kind of people (due to their interest in cryptocurrencies) to consider Bitcoin as something beautiful."[^159] It's this beauty that sparked the monetary reality we know today.

## The Currency of Disobedience {#la-monnaie-de-la-desobeissance .unnumbered}

When presenting Bitcoin, questions about its value proposition arise immediately. Why Bitcoin? What sets it apart from state currencies, its main competitors? Why use bitcoin as money instead of the dollar or euro?

Because bitcoin, due to its decentralized and open nature, is a less effective currency than the dollar or euro in many cases: it's less widely accepted, harder to use, involves transaction fees, has fluctuating purchasing power, and poses more legal risks. These reasons make fiat currencies and centralized solutions more efficient (and will continue to be) in most situations.

This doesn't render Bitcoin useless—it just needs to be viewed from a particular perspective. Bitcoin is a "permissionless" monetary system, usable without anyone's authorization. It's electronic cash enabling direct and confidential exchanges between individuals without intermediaries. It offers the ability to have full control over one's funds and make transfers without fear of observation or censorship, to any recipient, anywhere, anytime.

Its value proposition stems from these straightforward characteristics. By being uncontrollable, Bitcoin serves as an instrument of *disobedience* to social norms and, especially, political power. It removes banks' and states' power to control and select transactions, which allows them to oversee economic activity, and their power over monetary issuance, which enables them to extract seigniorage revenue. Bitcoin is thus a concept of censorship-resistant money, difficult to prevent transactions, and inflation-resistant, hard to create more units than initially planned.

Bitcoin is built in opposition to the authorities and is part of the longstanding struggle against human subjugation. Its existence affirms the primacy of natural law over positive law, the superiority of individual property over collectivism. It fits within the liberal tradition of the right of resistance (*jus resistendi*), justifying individuals' or groups' secession against unjust laws—a right recognized by two major 18th-century revolutions: the American and French Revolutions.

It's a tool of civil disobedience, a concept outlined by Étienne de La Boétie in the 16th century, theorized by Henry David Thoreau in 1849, and practiced by Gandhi through *satyāgraha* in India and by Martin Luther King in the civil rights movement against racial segregation in the U.S. It's a message to the earthly sovereign, rejecting his decrees and declaring: "I will no longer use your currency."

Bitcoin was created to gain individual independence. Originating from the cypherpunk movement—a technical disobedience movement advocating proactive use of cryptography on the Internet to protect privacy and freedom—Bitcoin was launched by Satoshi Nakamoto without seeking permission from authorities, explicitly aiming to enhance freedom. On November 6, 2008, responding to someone stating he "wouldn't find a solution to political problems in cryptography," he said:

*"Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years."*[^160]

[^160]: Satoshi Nakamoto, *Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper*, November 6, 2008, 20:15:40 UTC, <https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014823.html>.

Thus, it's natural that the core activities built on Bitcoin lie at the margins of general public approval. Bitcoin involves reclaiming individual sovereignty against authority—a move that can be unpopular when laws have majority acceptance. It serves a niche market whose size depends on the proportion of the population willing to disobey.

Central uses of Bitcoin include political opposition. It can be an alternative means of funding (receiving) and payment (sending) for political organizations, often labeled extreme right or left, whose financial integrity is challenged by authorities.

Julian Assange and WikiLeaks exemplify this. After 2010 revelations about U.S. military practices in Afghanistan and Iraq, the organization faced a financial blockade from Mastercard, Visa, Western Union, Bank of America, and others, eliminating 95% of its revenue.[^161] This pushed it to accept bitcoin donations in June 2011, which, though modest at first, became substantial as bitcoin's value increased years later.

[^161]: WikiLeaks, *Banking Blockade*, October 24, 2011, 13:00 UTC, <https://wikileaks.org/Banking-Blockade.html>.

Another case is whistleblower Edward Snowden, a former CIA and NSA employee who revealed mass surveillance of the Internet and U.S. phone networks in 2013. Pursued by the U.S. for "espionage, theft, and unauthorized use of government property," he sought asylum in Russia, obtaining citizenship in 2022. Snowden supports Bitcoin, having used it in 2013 to pay for servers that shared information anonymously.[^162] He also promoted the cryptocurrency ZCash for its privacy features, participating in its 2016 initialization ceremony.

A third example is Alexei Navalny, Vladimir Putin's main opponent in Russia, founder of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), whose bank accounts were frozen in 2019 before its liquidation in 2021. Navalny has used Bitcoin for funding since 2017, with the equivalent of several million dollars passing through his address.[^163] According to his deputy, Leonid Volkov, bitcoin contributions represented 10% of their total funding. Navalny was incarcerated in Russia in January 2021 and remained so in November 2023.[^164]

[^164]: Alexei Navalny died in prison in February 2024. (Note from January 2025.)

Another use aligning with disobedience is funding the scientific article-sharing platform Sci-Hub, founded in 2011 by Alexandra Elbakyan, a young Kazakh inspired by communist ideals. The site's purpose (still online) is to provide free access to knowledge by sharing articles and works freely, defying copyright laws. Due to its illegal nature, the platform accepted bitcoin donations from its inception, receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars.[^165] It also faced recurring issues with PayPal, its only other revenue source, which permanently closed its account in 2020.

[^165]: The donation page is at <https://sci-hub.se/donate>. The former address 1K4t2vSBSS2xFjZ6PofYnbgZewjeqbG1TM (from an earlier site snapshot: <https://web.archive.org/web/20160202212649/http://sci-hub.la/>) received 94.42594975 BTC between 07/03/2015 and 11/14/2020. Other addresses linked to Sci-Hub are 12PCbUDS4ho7vgSccmixKTHmq9qL2mdSns and bc1q7eqheemcu6xpgr42vl0ayel6wj087nxdfjfndf.

More broadly, Bitcoin is useful geopolitically. The system isn't tied to any jurisdiction and isn't concerned with borders. It allows sending funds abroad while bypassing various constraints and regulations.

This makes it valuable for emigrants sending money to family in their home countries. These remittances often rely on centralized solutions like Western Union and MoneyGram, which charge high fees.

Similarly, Bitcoin can circumvent economic sanctions imposed by states on their populations amid power struggles. Its utility was evident following the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022, when the Western bloc imposed heavy financial sanctions on Russia. Bitcoin served both Russian citizens, who couldn't receive foreign funds, and Ukrainian nationals in occupied regions.

Thus, anyone under an authoritarian regime seeking to bypass laws or rebel against the status quo may find Bitcoin beneficial. This is where Bitcoin's core use lies: in what's forbidden and what can easily become so.

## The Currency of the Black Market {#la-monnaie-du-marche-noir .unnumbered}

Bitcoin is an electronic cash system usable confidentially, without permission, and with low censorship risk. Consequently, it's particularly suitable for economic activity escaping state supervision and taxation—what we commonly call the black market.

The term "black market" entered French during World War II under German occupation, translating the German *Schwarzmarkt*, dating back to World War I. It originally referred to clandestine markets circumventing trade regulations.

The term wasn't used earlier because regulations weren't pervasive enough to necessitate such a concept—the exchange of goods occurred simply in the market. Only "au noir" existed, describing undeclared activities hidden from authorities. As societies became more regulated, based on explicit laws rather than implicit norms, distinguishing regulated markets from free markets became necessary, leading to the term's emergence.

The black market concept is vague, covering both individual commercial activities and large-scale trafficking, the sale of legitimate goods and services, and products from criminal exploitation. Clarification is needed. Here, we define the black market as the free economy where goods and services—legal and illegal—are exchanged without regulation or taxation and aren't direct products of aggression. This includes the "grey market," where legal goods and services are traded (like undeclared work), and excludes the "red market," involving crimes like murder, extortion, or slavery.

To describe activities escaping state control and taxation, terms like underground economy, clandestine economy, or parallel economy are also used. This economy falls under the broader informal economy, not necessarily commercial, including activities like domestic work[^166]. In developing countries, this represents a significant economic portion.

[^166]: Domestic work (cooking, cleaning, laundry, childcare, etc.) was previously mainly done by women before they left the home and this work became taxed like any other. The society promoted by the modern state is primarily mercantile, where everything is sold and taxable from birth to death.

The black market thrives under restrictive economic conditions. During World War II[^167], its success stemmed from severe shortages caused by the war, price controls, and harsh conditions imposed by the German occupiers. The French population faced drastic rationing (the official adult food ration was 1,100 calories per day in 1942) and excessive levies through pillaging, taxes, or requisitions. Resorting to the black market became a necessity. The underground economy also prospered under repressive regimes, notably in the Soviet Union, where it was a "second economy" essential for survival[^168].

[^167]: Joël Drogland, "La France du marché noir", *La Cliothèque*, May 2, 2008: <https://clio-cr.clionautes.org/la-france-du-marche-noir-1940-1949.html>.

[^168]: The term comes from Gregory Grossman's 1977 article "*The Second Economy of the USSR*".

But the black market isn't just a controversial phenomenon; it's also foundational for a doctrine called *agorism*. Derived from the Ancient Greek ἀγορά (*agora*, meaning "marketplace"), agorism is a political philosophy from libertarianism, advocating the underground economy's practice as a peaceful means to reduce state influence. The doctrine was theorized in the 1970s by Samuel Edward Konkin III[^169], a Canadian in the U.S., an avid reader of Mises and Rothbard, seeking to radicalize the Austrian School's vision. After practicing his philosophy, he documented it in the 1980 *New Libertarian Manifesto*.

[^169]: The term "agorism" was coined by Konkin for his presentation at the *Free Enterprise Forum* in February 1974.

Agorism aimed to unite libertarian theory, based on the non-aggression principle[^170], with black market practices (which Konkin called the "counter-economy"[^171]) focused on profit pursuit. It was a strategy to progressively eradicate aggression (including the state's) through self-interested individual actions, creating a free society—the *agora*.

[^170]: Libertarianism is based on the non-aggression axiom formulated by economist Murray Rothbard in *For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto* in 1973: "No individual or group has the right to initiate force against another, threatening or committing physical violence against another's person or property."

[^171]: The term counter-economy mirrors "counter-culture," referencing the 1960s alternative culture in which Konkin participated.

Konkin applied Mises and Rothbard's analyses to the underground economy, considering the risk associated with illegal activity (fines, imprisonment, harm) as entrepreneurial risk. He wrote:

*"Why do people engage in the counter-economy without protection? Because the gain relative to the risk taken exceeds the expected loss. This applies to any economic activity, but for the counter-economy, it deserves special attention:

The fundamental principle of the counter-economy is to trade risk for profit."*[^172]

[^172]: Samuel Edward Konkin III, *New Libertarian Manifesto*, KoPubCo, 2006.

Thus, agorism encouraged improving one's life by slipping through the state's net, rather than engaging
