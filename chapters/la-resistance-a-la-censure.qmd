# Resistance to Censorship {#ch:censure}

[] {#enotezch:9 label="enotezch:9"}

[L]{.lettrine}[']{.smallcaps}One of the growing issues of our time is financial censorship. With the rise of the globalized economy, particularly reliant on the Internet, the use of financial intermediaries has become increasingly common. This evolution means that hindering monetary transfers now poses a widespread complication, experienced by a growing segment of the population.

Bitcoin offers a solution to this problem. One of its fundamental characteristics is its resistance to censorship—that is, the difficulty for any entity to prevent a payment from occurring. By allowing "online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution," Bitcoin bypasses the array of financial controls that burden our modern means of payment and savings.

Resistance to censorship, like transaction confirmation, is an economic mechanism. It essentially relies on proof of work as applied in Nakamoto's consensus algorithm. Consequently, alternative proposals such as proof-of-stake algorithms exhibit much weaker resistance to censorship.

In this chapter, we will first explore how financial censorship operates in today's banking world and why it is likely to become more widespread with the deployment of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the future. Then, we'll describe how censorship can be enacted within Bitcoin and how the system can resist it. Finally, we'll explain why alternative proposals are insufficient.

## What Do We Mean by Financial Censorship? {#quentendons-nous-par-censure-financière .unnumbered}

At first glance, the notion of censorship might seem odd when discussing money. Commonly, censorship refers to the restriction of expression, particularly through the prohibition of disseminating certain ideas. However, we can understand it in a broader sense that intertwines payment and expression.

The term "censorship" comes from the Latin *censeo*, meaning "to evaluate," "to estimate," "to declare," or "to judge." It originates from a significant institution of the Roman Republic: the censors, two magistrates tasked with conducting a census of citizens and their property (*census*), collecting taxes, supervising public works, managing the list of those admitted to the Senate (*album senatorium*), and ensuring the maintenance of "good morals" among the population by administering reprimands or temporary penalties. The censors' first function gave rise to the term "census." The second led to concepts like "cens" (property assessment) and censitary suffrage. The last function sparked what we now call censorship.

During the Middle Ages, the Latin word *censura* was adopted by the Catholic Church to take on a religious meaning, focusing solely on speech—particularly texts. Censorship then resembled a reprimand (a sense still sometimes used today, especially in literary criticism) or a prohibition. It involved reviewing and correcting written works to ensure they conformed to the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church.

However, the advent of the printing press in the 15th century disrupted this control: the number of books exploded, diminishing the Church's grip over publications—a control that transitioned to the State. Consequently, censorship acquired its current political meaning, referring to the State's examination of books, newspapers, plays, etc., to permit or prohibit their publication or performance. Over time, the term came to denote any infringement on freedom of expression, regardless of the medium, whether enacted before (a priori censorship) or after (a posteriori censorship) dissemination.

With the rise of mass media (newspapers, radio, television) and especially social media, the term has broadened further. Censorship now often refers to any editorial decision made by a private entity regarding its customers or users. While this private censorship isn't an infringement on freedom of expression in the strictest sense, it becomes problematic when the field is monopolized by a few actors who often benefit from legal advantages or state subsidies. Moreover, such censorship can directly stem from political intervention, with platforms merely implementing government directives[^393].

Furthermore, censorship of expression can be executed by hindering the economic activity of the speaker. By restricting someone's ability to earn money and signaling that their speech is problematic, one can compel them to silence themselves. This context gave rise to the concept of financial censorship, defined by the international organization *Students for Liberty* as "restricting a private entity's financial activity to inhibit its operations, with the implicit intention of silencing it"[^394]. The *Electronic Frontier Foundation* shares this definition.

However, the repercussions of financial control extend beyond expression and can affect human action in general. Financial censorship can thus be understood more broadly, as adopted by three researchers from San Jose State University who state: "Financial censorship occurs when a financial institution denies its services to a party because of that party's expressed opinions, actions, or industry"[^395].

Finally, financial censorship can be seen as the financial restriction itself, provided it rests on an external subjective criterion (adherence to arbitrary norms) rather than an objective economic factor like paying a commission. Censorship can be public (legal prohibition of a transaction), private (by a bank, for example), or both. This definition still embodies the idea of shaping individual behavior through financial intervention—a meaning attributed to censorship in Bitcoin.

In general terms, financial censorship involves directly restricting an entity's financial activities to inhibit its expression or actions. The aim is to influence individuals by controlling the money they use, a tool essential for their economic survival. Today, censorship primarily targets bank credit, with transfers heavily regulated by authorities. In the future, it could extend to digital currencies managed by central banks.

## Banking and Censorship {#la-banque-et-la-censure .unnumbered}

Financial censorship operates through control over monetary transfers, making it difficult to apply such censorship to physical cash. Cash (in the form of precious metal coins or banknotes) enables direct, confidential, person-to-person exchanges, preventing most restrictions except in specific cases.

In contrast, banking involves clients holding accounts where banks record credits and manage transfers. This setup makes financial restrictions much easier: banks can select which transfers to process, temporarily freeze accounts, and even refuse cash withdrawals. The same applies to services built atop the traditional banking system, like PayPal.

Thus, the increase in financial censorship naturally coincided with society's bankization, which began in the 1960s in the West. This era saw the widespread adoption of checking accounts and related payment methods like checks, credit cards, and transfers. Over a few decades, payments shifted to the banking sector, encouraged by law and offering more convenience than cash—which itself faced legal restrictions. As a result, censorship became more effective: if cash no longer allows people to manage their affairs adequately, opting out of the banking system is no longer viable.

This censorship was implemented through financial surveillance, now commonplace in the banking industry. Banks are legally obligated to monitor their clients and intervene upon detecting "suspicious" behavior, whether by blocking transfers or freezing accounts. They don't do this willingly; instead, they aim to protect themselves from potential regulatory complications, not to "protect" their clients.

Regulations tightened as banking became more widespread. Starting in the 1970s, combating money laundering—especially in the context of the war on drugs—became the primary justification for imposing restrictions on banks. In the U.S., banking regulations significantly tightened after the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 aimed at fighting money laundering.

With the Internet's emergence in the 1990s, international banking usage required increased regulation. Various surveillance organizations were established. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body issuing recommendations on regulatory standards and economic sanctions, was created in July 1989 to combat money laundering. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury collecting and analyzing financial transaction information, was established on April 25, 1990. France's equivalent, TRACFIN (Treatment of Intelligence and Action Against Illicit Financial Circuits), appeared in July 1990. The European Union's first directive on preventing the use of the financial system for money laundering dates back to June 10, 1990.

After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a new pretext emerged: combating the financing of terrorism. In the U.S., this materialized as the PATRIOT Act in October 2001, with Title III addressing financial restrictions. In France, the law of November 15, 2001, on daily security reclassified "the act of financing a terrorist enterprise" as an act of terrorism itself[^396]. Financial surveillance intensified accordingly.

These developments form the foundation of what's generally known as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) standards. This tightening is characterized by Know Your Customer (KYC) practices, also called customer due diligence, which involve verifying each client's identity, compliance, and associated risks. Today, this identification requirement is integrated into all financial services.

As a result, bank secrecy—the obligation for banks not to disclose client information to third parties—has effectively disappeared, even in Switzerland. Using a bank account today presupposes comprehensive transaction surveillance and meticulous scrutiny of unusual operations. Transferring large sums without justification has become impossible.

This financial environment was summarized in January 2009 by Jonathan Thornburg, responding to Satoshi Nakamoto on a mailing list about the potential uses of Bitcoin:

"In the modern world, no major nation wants to allow untraceable international financial transactions beyond a relatively modest threshold. (Common buzzwords include 'drug money laundering,' 'tax evasion,' and/or 'terrorism financing.') As a result, electronic financial transactions are currently monitored by various nation-states and their agencies, and all but the smallest transactions are now subject to various identification requirements for the parties at each end"[^397].

## Instances of Financial Censorship {#les-cas-de-censure-financière .unnumbered}

In recent years, notable cases of financial censorship have multiplied, making exhaustive listing impossible. We'll highlight some prominent examples in the West, keeping in mind that those affected often don't publicize this censorship.

Perhaps the most well-known example is the financial blockade against WikiLeaks, initiated by Mastercard, Visa, Western Union, Bank of America, and others in December 2010 to silence the organization. By October 2011, WikiLeaks reported that the blockade had cut off 95% of its revenue. This event had direct repercussions in Bitcoin's history, as recounted in Chapter [1](#ch:mythe){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:mythe"}.

Another case targeting specific professions was Operation Choke Point, conducted between 2013 and 2017 by the U.S. Department of Justice. The operation aimed to "choke off" certain industries by restricting their access to credit and other banking services. Activities deemed "high-risk" included pawn or payday lending, gambling, pornography, escort services, as well as the sale of tobacco, pharmaceuticals, coins, dating services, and even travel clubs. Arms and ammunition sales were also targeted. Defense Distributed, the libertarian crypto-anarchist Cody Wilson's company specializing in distributing 3D-printed firearm designs, faced account closures from Chase, PayPal, and Stripe in 2015.

In 2018, political opinions became a censorship target. Numerous American alt-right personalities and organizations were banned from social networks and lost access to financial services. The most emblematic case was Alex Jones, founder of the alternative news site InfoWars, who, besides being purged from social media in the summer of 2018, had his PayPal account closed. Other examples include the social platform Gab (banned from PayPal, Stripe Cash App, and Coinbase), Milo Yiannopoulos (banned from PayPal for a Nazi salute), and Robert Spencer (blogger of the anti-Islam site Jihad Watch, ousted from Patreon under Mastercard's pressure). In France, this censorship targeted Égalité et Réconciliation, the association of anti-Zionist Alain Soral, which was excluded from PayPal in August 2018 during a similar purge. The association also saw multiple bank accounts (Banque Postale, BNP Paribas, Banque Populaire) closed over the years.

In the political realm, but in China, the movement against the Hong Kong government's proposed extradition law amendment—from March 2019 to July 2020—faced interventions from the international banking giant HSBC, likely under pressure from the central Chinese government. In November 2019, HSBC's Hong Kong subsidiary closed an account used to support the protest movement. Then, in December 2020, it froze the account of democrat Ted Hui. By 2023, it emerged that HSBC was denying Hong Kongers who fled to the UK access to their pension funds, totaling £2.2 billion.

More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic provided additional examples of financial censorship. Activists opposing measures like lockdowns, mask mandates, and mandatory vaccinations faced extensive censorship, often accused of spreading misinformation. The Dutch action group Viruswaarheid—opposing social distancing, lockdowns, curfews, and vaccination programs—had its donation-receiving bank account closed by ING Bank in February 2021.

A standout event is the Canadian "Freedom Convoy" of February 2022, initiated by truckers protesting mandatory vaccinations for cross-border travel. They converged on Ottawa to express their discontent. The movement encountered severe financial censorship. Initially, crowdfunding platforms canceled campaigns intended to support the truckers' journey: GoFundMe withdrew a campaign that had raised 10 million Canadian dollars on February 4; funds raised through campaigns on the Christian platform GiveSendGo (around 9 million dollars) were frozen by the Ontario government and couldn't be distributed. Financial repression escalated when, following the state of emergency declared by Justin Trudeau on February 14, the Canadian government froze personal and business bank accounts linked to the movement: 280 accounts containing a total of 8 million dollars were frozen. The following year, Judge Paul Rouleau, heading the Commission on the State of Emergency, stated that freezing bank accounts was a "powerful tool to discourage participation [in the protests] and encourage protesters to leave"[^398].

Another significant event was the tightening of economic sanctions against Russia by Western states following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Financial sanctions included excluding certain Russian banks from the SWIFT system, prohibiting financing in Russia and the purchase of rubles, and banning the provision of wallet, account, or custody services for crypto-assets. Generally, transfers to Russia were prohibited, preventing exiled Russian citizens from sending money to their families. This also affected Ukrainians whose relatives remained in territories occupied by the Russian army, such as a Ukrainian woman in France unable to send a 100-euro bank transfer to her parents in Donetsk.

In the West, financial measures were also taken to enforce censorship of Kremlin-funded media. In January 2023, RT France, already banned from broadcasting in Europe but still accessible online, had its assets frozen, forcing it to close permanently.

Lastly, in discussing financial censorship instances, we must mention activities related to cryptocurrencies, which continue to face restrictions from financial institutions. Banks regularly impede cryptocurrency purchases by prohibiting clients (claiming to "protect" them) from sending funds to exchanges. Additionally, companies in the sector often struggle to open bank accounts due to traditional institutions' mistrust[^399].

Financial censorship is increasingly prevalent in our society. It affects many individuals across political spectrums, nationalities, and professions. Often enacted without specific legal decisions, it imparts a hidden, arbitrary nature to the exertion of real power, making it a subtle and challenging issue to articulate.

The intensification of this censorship drives people to explore Bitcoin. Experiencing such restrictions naturally leads individuals to seek ways to circumvent them, even if minor. When people grasp censorship as a concrete reality rather than an abstract risk, they feel compelled to liberate themselves and safeguard against this danger, highlighting (or reaffirming) Bitcoin's value proposition[^400]. This was the case for the author of this book, whose bank account was frozen without notice or explanation, only regaining access to his funds six months later.

## Censorship and Central Bank Digital Currency {#censure-et-monnaie-numérique-de-banque-centrale .unnumbered}

The trend is clear: with the widespread use of bank accounts over cash, the power of financial censorship has grown significantly. While this censorship remains occasional today, we can anticipate it becoming a more pressing issue in the future, especially with the gradual deployment of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the concurrent decline of physical cash.

As discussed in the section on central bank digital currencies in Chapter [4](#ch:adversaire){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:adversaire"}, digitizing money is the next step in state-issued currency evolution. Since 2016, central banks worldwide have been designing systems usable by the general public, with communications on the subject increasing since 2020.

Such digital currencies would allow for additional seigniorage income by eliminating cash production costs and reclaiming monetary activities currently facilitated through credit issued by commercial banks. More pertinent here, they would enable total financial control over citizens' transactions by centralizing system management within the central bank and accredited organizations.

This control would naturally come with enhanced financial surveillance, justified by familiar pretexts like combating money laundering and terrorism financing. This could lead to a panoptic system where surveillance occurs without the subject's awareness. Central banks deny intentions to move in this direction, but they will never make their systems entirely confidential, always reserving oversight rights for competent authorities.

Financial surveillance could be reinforced by the gradual disappearance of cash, already underway in some parts of the world. In Sweden, discussions about ending cash are active, with the state promoting innovative digital payment methods. In China, most transactions occur through mobile payment systems like WeChat Pay and Alipay. It's no coincidence that these two countries were among the first to seriously consider developing a digital currency.

The war on cash manifests in some countries through demonetizing certain circulating bills, which can be exchanged for other bills or deposited into bank accounts upon proof of fund origin. In November 2016, India's government, led by Narendra Modi, demonetized 500 and 1,000 rupee notes (worth approximately $7.50 and $15), constituting 86% of currency in circulation, aiming to combat counterfeit banknotes, tax evasion, and the informal economy. In early 2023, Nigeria attempted a similar move by limiting withdrawals and demonetizing large denominations to control inflation, fight counterfeiting, and promote the electronic naira (eNaira) launched by the central bank in October 2021. Such demonetization isn't new; post-World War II Europe saw similar actions to curb inflation and eliminate black-market profits, leading the character Le Dabe in *The Counterfeiters of Paris* to remark, "When it comes to money, states have all the rights, and individuals none!"

With digital currency in place and cash significantly restricted, law-abiding citizens would have no choice but to use this surveilled system. The system could limit spending amounts, dictate usage purposes, and control trading partners. Moreover, being a computerized system, it could easily be programmed to impose spending conditions on users' funds. Such programmability would allow authorities to steer individuals' political, economic, and moral behaviors in desired directions, giving financial censorship unprecedented reach.

Economically, this could enhance what central bankers call monetary policy transmission—the process by which monetary policy decisions affect the broader economy and price levels. Currently, this transmission primarily operates through adjusting key interest rates. In the future, it could involve programming the currency itself, transforming social aid systems into direct subsidies requiring rapid spending in specific economic sectors to stimulate them.

Morally, such programmability could massively influence people's words and actions. In our modern society, this might occur under the guise of combating climate change by rewarding "eco-friendly" behaviors (like renting bikes) and penalizing "polluting" ones (like consuming meat). This suggests the potential establishment of a Chinese-style social credit system.

Politically, this system could suppress opposition by penalizing those with dissenting thoughts, outspoken critics, or protesters. Authorities could strengthen their position by enforcing measures not through public and legal avenues (aligned with the concept of the rule of law), but via covert and discretionary means. This could usher in the beginnings of a totalitarian regime where the state knows all, controls all, and formal laws become unnecessary. The CBDC would serve as a powerful tool for mass financial surveillance, potentially paving the way for an Orwellian future where individuals lack privacy and have minimal ability to resist authority.

Such widespread financial censorship would be unprecedented. Implementing it manually would be challenging, necessitating delegation to algorithms equipped with artificial intelligence to detect and instantly block undesired transactions. The CBDC system could lead us toward a scenario reminiscent of Saint John's description in the *Book of Revelation*:

"By these means, all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, will receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they cannot buy or sell unless they have the mark—the name of the beast or the number of its name"[^401].

In this dystopian world, whose ramifications we can scarcely imagine, hope would be embodied by Bitcoin, whose fundamental promise is to escape such interventions. Through its resistance to censorship, Bitcoin would serve as an oasis of freedom amid widespread servitude. Essentially, it would be the last refuge for a population ensnared by technological subjugation.

## Censorship in Bitcoin {#la-censure-dans-bitcoin .unnumbered}

To understand how Bitcoin opposes censorship, we must examine how censorship can be applied to the blockchain. While the Nakamoto model is reputed to be *resistant* to censorship, this doesn't mean it's "uncensorable." Censorship in Bitcoin is not only possible but also likely beyond a certain adoption stage.

In the context of Bitcoin, "censorship" specifically refers to the action of preventing a transaction from being executed on an economically irrational basis by hindering its permanent inclusion in the blockchain. This definition aligns with the idea of restricting an entity's financial activity to shape its behavior. In a sense, this censorship resembles speech censorship, as it indirectly prevents an individual from recording a signed transaction in a ledger.

Censorship in Bitcoin can be extrapolated from existing practices in the banking world and the cryptocurrency sector, beginning with the justifications used to defend it. On one hand, traditional finance's reasons apply to Bitcoin: combating money laundering, terrorism financing, and protecting investors—since cryptocurrency can facilitate tax evasion, fund various projects, and partake in scams. On the other hand, new pretexts emerge, such as preventing local currency devaluation (a deflationary instrument poses unfair competition) or combating climate change (mining emits CO₂).

Authorities derive general regulations from these pretexts, applied internationally, as seen in the global banking system. Different jurisdictions base their policies on FATF recommendations, primarily aimed at fighting money laundering and terrorism financing. As discussed regarding jurisdictional arbitration (see Chapter [4](#ch:adversaire){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:adversaire"}), countries are strongly encouraged to implement these recommendations to avoid economic sanctions from member states. The IMF can also be leveraged, aiming to ensure global monetary system stability (thus protecting member states' currencies).

This cooperation enables the creation of blacklists of addresses non-compliant with regulations, distributed to various regulated financial actors. Examples include lists compiled by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a U.S. Treasury agency enforcing international financial sanctions, which wields significant influence due to the extraterritoriality of U.S. law.

Censorship already exists within parts of the Bitcoin economy. Regulated entities block bitcoins (and other cryptocurrencies) from blacklisted addresses and freeze user accounts until they provide explanations. However, this practice remains partial and implicit: transactions themselves aren't explicitly prohibited yet, but funds must not be sent to regulated financial intermediaries like exchanges or payment processors. This situation pushes some platforms to overcompensate by rejecting bitcoins originating from coin mixers and freezing accounts of users engaging in such activities, even without explicit regulations[^402].

Regulations can also extend to the mining industry. Mining naturally tends toward centralization through hash power aggregation in mining farms, miners joining pools, and pools using communication relays. These large entities are often identifiable and more likely to comply with transaction-processing regulations, potentially leading to network censorship.

Miners might initially practice passive censorship by systematically refusing to confirm certain transactions for economically irrational reasons, typically under regulatory pressure. This type of censorship was considered by Marathon Group's pool in 2021, which announced plans to practice "clean block mining"[^403] before retracting under public pressure. On Ethereum, this filtering occurs with validators using MEV-boost relays complying with OFAC standards, excluding transactions deemed illicit[^404]. As of 2023, participants in these relays were primarily exchanges.

Passive censorship isn't overly problematic since it requires 100% compliance by miners to be effective. Dissident miners—those deliberately ignoring regulations—can validate ignored transactions, mitigating the impact. Only confirmation times might be affected.

The situation becomes more severe if compliant miners (strictly adhering to regulations) start rejecting blocks containing "illicit" transactions. This active censorship involves preventing transactions from being confirmed by orphaning any blocks that include them. Sustaining this requires majority control of the network's hash power—essentially a 51% attack. The weaker branches formed by the censorship attack are abandoned due to the longest-chain rule, as illustrated in Figure [9.1](#fig:censorship-attack){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:censorship-attack"}.

![Active Censorship Attack.](img/mining-attack-censorship.png){#fig:censorship-attack}

Such an attack's cost can be colossal, depending on the hash power deployed[^405]. However, this cost might be justified by the suppression of activities avoiding taxes and seigniorage. As discussed in Chapter [4](#ch:adversaire){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:adversaire"}, the typical attacker is the state, whose extraction power heavily relies on monetary control—it may not mind reducing (or destroying) Bitcoin's utility to achieve its goals.

This hypothetical attack would likely be preceded by a declaration of war against Bitcoin. Tolerance toward users would vanish, and unofficial activities would become official targets: all transactions not explicitly authorized would be declared illegal. Free usage would be criminalized, and honest mining would be targeted.

Such a crackdown would help co-opt more mining pools, transmitting state directives to them. The state could also requisition or purchase its own mining hardware, eventually amassing majority hash power. With sufficient power, the attack would commence.

Active censorship is insidious because only 51% compliance is needed for enforcement. Prolonged over time, it could establish a new norm. Economically rational miners might be incentivized to comply with censorship, as Juraj Bednar discussed[^406]. The attacker doesn't necessarily need to maintain majority hash power indefinitely.

Privacy doesn't prevent censorship but increases its cost. If all users refuse to comply with surveillance norms, censors would have to reject all transactions, forfeiting corresponding fees. The attack would effectively entail destroying the blockchain's utility by mining empty blocks—a Goldfinger attack, named after the antagonist in the 1964 James Bond film who sought to irradiate the U.S. gold reserve at Fort Knox to render it unusable and inflate the value of his own gold[^407].

Thus, censorship in Bitcoin is possible. However, it's neither easy nor definitive, thanks to a protocol mechanism designed to combat such attacks: resistance to censorship.

## The Mechanism of Resistance to Censorship {#le-mécanisme-de-résistance-à-la-censure .unnumbered}

Resistance to censorship refers to the difficulty of arbitrarily obstructing transactions. It's commonly cited as one of Bitcoin's key promises: allowing anyone to send funds to anyone else, anytime, anywhere, provided they have Internet access.

Resistance to censorship is crucial for Bitcoin. Without it, the system couldn't survive as it would become a centrally controlled platform, with an authority deciding which transactions are acceptable. It would need to adapt (like GoldMoney or PayPal) or perish (like e-gold or Liberty Reserve). Moreover, absolute control over transaction selection would allow such an authority to exert irresistible influence over the protocol through soft forks (as we'll explore in Chapters [10](#ch:changement){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:changement"} and [11](#ch:determination){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:determination"}), ultimately destroying the original monetary policy. Without resistance to censorship, Bitcoin's value proposition collapses.

However, Satoshi Nakamoto never explicitly described this resistance. In his communications, he explained how his system was economically secured against double-spending—a significant advancement over previous decentralized models—but didn't elaborate on opposing censorship, i.e., partially or entirely blocking transactional activity by a hostile entity. He seemed to rely on the goodwill of "honest" miners, even suggesting there would "probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free"[^408], implying resistance was a given.

The mechanism of resistance to censorship was highlighted in 2018 by developer and author Eric Voskuil, who showed it fundamentally relies on transaction fees[^409]. Similar to resistance against double-spending, resistance to censorship isn't absolute but economic: regulation funded by fees from prohibited transactions.

Mining security hinges on a majority principle: the computing power controlled by honest miners must exceed that of attackers. The crucial factor isn't the highest possible hash rate but that miners with significant power are willing to mine all transactions paying appropriate fees and consistently build on the longest chain.

Thus, security isn't solely dependent on hash power. It also involves the distribution of that power and the proportion of miners relative to the broader population[^410]. A hash rate concentrated in a single miner's hands would offer security equivalent to a centralized system, dependent on that miner. Conversely, a widely distributed network with substantial hash power may face co-option risks if it comprises few miners compared to one with many.

The solution to censorship lies with dissident miners willing to confirm contentious or illegal transactions. The risks these miners face must be economically compensated.

Dissident miners need anonymity to mine clandestinely. This is ensured as miners aren't required to identify themselves within the protocol. Reporting mined blocks by pools is optional and voluntary, intended to reassure users about network distribution.

The portion of mining revenue from new coin creation plays a minor role in combating censorship, whether passive or active. This reward is identical for all miners, so it doesn't influence their economic choice to include or exclude transactions. Furthermore, potential utility loss (and thus mining revenue) from active censorship (an attack) wouldn't deter the authority aiming to achieve control or destruction by dictating permissible transactions.

In contrast, transaction fees are crucial to the resistance mechanism. Integrated into the protocol, these fees are publicly associated with each transaction. They counter passive censorship by incentivizing miners to confirm transactions and deter active censorship by enhancing the economic weight of the censored branch.

In an active censorship attack, censors obtain over half the network's computing power and openly reject certain transactions (e.g., via a blacklist) by refusing blocks containing them. The censors' chain is considered valid by honest nodes due to its length.

Here, the fee mechanism plays a role. Users of censored transactions, noticing delays, increase their fees—a natural response observed during network congestion, like during the 2017 bubble when median transaction fees exceeded $30. It's logical to pay higher fees to transfer large sums, which carry more risk than small transfers[^411].

This increase generates additional fees—the difference between fees from all transactions and those from unauthorized transactions in honest nodes' mempools. This surplus incentivizes dissident miners to deploy more hash power over time: the larger the suppressed economy, the greater the resulting hash power differential.

Dissident miners coordinate privately or signal to plan a response. Once sufficient hash power is gathered, they begin confirming censored transactions. With majority power, their chain becomes the longest, invalidating the censors' chain. Thus, censorship is overcome—at least until the next attack.

Therefore, the resistance mechanism is deeply embedded in the protocol. Proof of work, anonymous mining, and the integrated fee system collectively enable coordinating a fee market to repel censors. While we can't guarantee Bitcoin's uncensorability—given unknowns like the censored economy's size, attack scale, or users' willingness to pay fees—the mechanism remains functional.

Notably, the role of transaction fees, elucidated by Eric Voskuil in 2018, has been overlooked by some crypto-economic protocols. Ethereum, for instance, opted to burn a portion of network fees to make ether deflationary with EIP-1559's activation in August 2021. The Ethereum community also transitioned to proof of stake in September 2022, marking another step toward accepting censorship, as we'll explain later.

## The Importance of Privacy {#limportance-de-la-confidentialité .unnumbered}

Financial censorship closely aligns with transaction surveillance. Such surveillance refines transaction selection, allowing subtle control over the economy without alarming compliant individuals. This applies to both traditional banking and Bitcoin.

Protecting one's wealth and freedom can be approached in two ways: physical defense and concealment. Physical defense involves directly safeguarding property (possibly with firearms) or indirectly through state police or private security services—a common choice among the wealthy. While effective against common criminals, it's less so against the dominant local power—the state.

Consequently, individuals often opt for concealment, hiding their wealth to prevent others from seizing it directly. This deters aggressors relying on threats of violence, as extracting information incurs additional costs proportional to resistance.

This method ties directly to privacy—the act of restricting information to a select few. Privacy differs from secrecy in that one can choose to reveal information selectively. In financial contexts, this means ensuring transaction details are known only to participants.

Privacy underpins individual freedom in society and is essential for everyone. It creates an asymmetry between the weak and the strong, the individual and the state, preventing absolute encroachment on individual rights. States may argue otherwise, suggesting those with nothing to hide have nothing to fear[^412], but history—especially 20th-century totalitarian regimes—proves this false.

Thus, because financial censorship originates from state initiatives, resistance to censorship is intrinsically linked to privacy.

On one hand, individual resistance to censorship relies on system privacy. If the state knows all transactions, it can penalize users for unauthorized transactions, even if confirmed by the network. Some BTC proponents highlight protocol transparency as an advantage over opaque banking systems, emphasizing pseudonymity and reserving anonymity for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero. However, this misunderstands transparency's role: in Bitcoin, data is public solely to ensure consensus and auditability; Monero simply implements a different transparency compromise.

On the other hand, user privacy depends on the system's resistance to censorship. If the state controls transaction selection, it can choose to confirm only transactions revealing sender and recipient identities. Some Monero advocates argue that default system privacy protects users from censorship, as the state can't censor unknown transactions. However, this view is naive, as users can technically disclose address-related information to surveillance authorities[^413]; the main barrier is the additional cost such surveillance entails.

Therefore, privacy and resistance to censorship are interdependent in Bitcoin. Without privacy, individual resistance to censorship falters; without resistance to censorship, individual privacy erodes. Consequently, widespread surveillance poses a significant threat.

Surveillance has expanded in Bitcoin alongside its economic growth, through regulation of financial intermediaries. Cryptocurrency exchanges have been compelled to implement KYC and AML standards akin to traditional banking. This information gathering has fostered blockchain analytics firms like Chainalysis and CipherTrace, which cross-reference identification data with blockchain events to derive probable interpretations, providing results to clients like state agencies and financial institutions. The net tightens further with adaptations of the "Travel Rule" recommended by the FATF and enforced by entities like Switzerland's FINMA, requiring intermediaries to verify withdrawal addresses[^414].

This evolution poses a substantial threat to Bitcoin. In response, efforts to thwart surveillance have emerged, including privacy-enhancing techniques like coin mixing (CoinJoin) and methods integrated into Monero. We'll delve into this in Chapter [12](#ch:rouages){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:rouages"}.

In summary, privacy is vital for preserving wealth and autonomy. True freedom demands protecting one's private life. As the writer Florian aptly noted: "To live happily, live hidden"[^415].

## Human Interventions in Consensus {#les-interventions-humaines-dans-le-consensus .unnumbered}

The possibility of censorship in Bitcoin often inspires a search for solutions, reflecting the engineer mindset common among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Many are drawn to alternatives to fee-based regulation: direct human intervention on the blockchain. This involves leveraging "social consensus," or the protocol's determination mechanism. Two ideas gaining traction are anti-censorship UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) and proof-of-work change UAHF (User Activated Hard Fork). However, we'll argue that this temptation is dangerous.

The first idea is to reject censorship by invalidating the censors' chain partially or entirely, violating the longest-chain principle. This can be achieved by rendering censors' blocks invalid or enforcing the validity of an alternative chain via a temporary checkpoint. Such measures constitute a soft fork (a restriction of consensus rules) and require user activation at a specific timestamp or block height, hence a UASF. This approach causes a split, as it lacks majority hash power support in censorship scenarios.

The concept of invalidating censorship through social consensus was discussed by Vitalik Buterin in 2016 regarding proof of stake:

"On medium to long time scales, humans are quite good at consensus. Even if an attacker had unlimited hash power and managed a 51% attack against a major blockchain, reversing even just the last month of history, convincing the community of the new chain's legitimacy would be much harder. They'd need to compromise block explorers, trusted community members, major media outlets, and more—convincing the world their chain came first. These social considerations ultimately protect any blockchain in the long term, whether the community admits it or not (note that Bitcoin Core acknowledges the primacy of the social layer)"[^416].

This measure can be implemented through direct invalidation, but it's feasible only if censors mark their blocks in some way. This was done by Bitcoin ABC on December 1, 2020, to counter an active censorship attack from a disgruntled miner following a split with Bitcoin Cash[^417].

Alternatively, checkpoints can be incorporated into the protocol—blocks deemed valid by default. This mechanism was added to Bitcoin software in July 2010 to prevent deep reorganizations; some checkpoints remain in Bitcoin Core[^418]. By enforcing a specific block, censors' chains can be invalidated. Bitcoin SV employed this in August 2021 amid active censorship[^419].

While such interventions might offer temporary relief, they don't provide robust censorship resistance. Relying on social agreement for consensus introduces instability. It opens the door for hostile entities to destabilize the system by sowing discord within the community (e.g., pressuring influencers), leading to splits that can't be objectively resolved.

Direct human intervention in transaction confirmation is thus ill-advised. Even if participants agree on the undesirability of an event, they often disagree on handling it, as seen in the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split. Humans can reach consensus long-term, as evidenced by convergence in languages, religions, currencies, etc. However, short-term consensus is unlikely, necessitating automated mechanisms like mining.

Another proposed measure, less subjective but more disruptive, is altering the proof-of-work function. This would halt an attack by rendering censors' specialized hardware obsolete, inflicting financial loss. It's a hard fork (incompatible consensus rule change) requiring user activation—a UAHF. This extreme option was supported by developers like Luke-Jr and Gregory Maxwell during the block size debate (2015–2016) and defended by Bitcoin ABC's lead developer Amaury Séchet in November 2018, calling it a "nuclear option of last resort"[^420].

Like invalidating censorship through social intervention, this route is more harmful long-term than maintaining the status quo. Firstly, losses incurred by censors also affect honest and dissident miners. Secondly, the economy splits between two chains, reducing overall utility. Thirdly, attack costs decrease short-term. Fourthly, miners lose protocol confidence, necessitating risk hedging against future changes, raising security costs. Lastly, the new mining distribution may not improve over the old, as large miners can deploy capital more efficiently.

Overall, short-term human intervention is undesirable. If the chain faces a mining attack, it's likely under social attack too. Interventions may multiply, leading to spiraling splits and economic insignificance. The case of Bitcoin Cash illustrates this: due to biannual hard forks, it underwent two major splits post-separation from Bitcoin-BTC (in 2018 with BSV and in 2020 with XEC), collectively valued at less than 1% of BTC's aggregate value. Such risks are magnified for a mature Bitcoin supporting a large, diverse economy.

## Variants of Proof-of-Work Consensus {#les-variantes-des-consensus-par-preuve-de-travail .unnumbered}

Censorship risks have inspired alternative consensus algorithms to Nakamoto's. The most notable is proof of stake, discussed in the next section. Other alternatives modify the proof-of-work algorithm, with three main variants: merged mining, proof of space, and early finalization.

The first is merged mining—simultaneously mining multiple chains by reusing work from a parent chain to validate auxiliary chains.

Satoshi Nakamoto described this in December 2010 regarding BitDNS (the precursor to Namecoin). He wrote:

"I think it's possible for BitDNS to be a completely separate network and have its own blockchain, yet share proof-of-work with Bitcoin. The only overlap would be miners able to search for proof-of-work for both networks simultaneously.

Networks wouldn't need coordination. Miners would run both networks in parallel, hashing in such a way that solutions solve both. A solution might apply to only one network if difficulties differ.

An external miner could call 'getwork' on both programs and combine the work.

Rather than fragmenting effort, networks would share and increase total computational power. This solves the issue of multiple networks endangering each other if computational power concentrates on one. Instead, all networks share combined power, making it easier for smaller networks to launch by tapping into existing miners"[^421].

Merged mining reuses partial proof-of-work from a parent chain as valid for an auxiliary chain. These auxiliary proofs (AuxPoW) are mining byproducts requiring no additional energy—only management of the auxiliary chain.

Auxiliary chain miners receive extra rewards from local coin creation (if using a new unit) and transaction fees, incentivizing parent chain miners to participate. This allows auxiliary chains to quickly gain significant hash rates.

Merged mining facilitates bootstrapping new cryptocurrencies by leveraging established mining industries. It has been implemented with Namecoin (relative to Bitcoin) and Dogecoin (relative to Litecoin). It's also suggested for sidechain synchronization, as in RSK's hybrid implementation, and considered in Paul Sztorc's Drivechain proposal (see Chapter [14](#ch:scalabilite){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:scalabilite"}).

However, merged mining's security benefits over classic mining are limited. While it increases participants and restricts attackers (to parent chain miners), attack costs remain tied to the auxiliary chain's mining revenue and, in censorship cases, transaction fees.

An illustrative example is Coiledcoin (CLC), an alternative cryptocurrency launched in January 2012, which suffered a fatal censorship attack soon after. Bitcoin developer Luke-Jr executed the attack via his mining pool Eligius without informing miners. He noted that no pool members suffered losses—the main cost was his time configuring software[^422].

Merged mining affects parent chain mining security by artificially increasing block mining power, seemingly beneficial but ineffective against transaction censorship. It also centralizes mining due to the burden of managing auxiliary chains: if they become economically significant, parent chain miners must mine them to remain profitable.

The second alternative is proof of space (or capacity/storage), based on memory storage rather than computing power—the resource is disk space.

This idea has partially appeared in hybrid proof-of-work algorithms to deter specialized hardware (ASICs) and favor general hardware (CPUs, GPUs). Examples include the scrypt function in Tenebrix (inherited by Litecoin), Ethereum's former Ethash algorithm, and Monero's RandomX.

Pure proof-of-space algorithms exist, such as Chia Network's system by Bram Cohen, using "proofs of space and time" to determine the correct chain.

These algorithms aim to enhance censorship resistance by encouraging broader participation, improving validation distribution. However, they merely shift the problem. Proof of space still involves external energy expenditure, resembling proof of work. Optimization remains possible at hardware (ASICs) and industrial levels (economies of scale), so centralization pressures persist. The goal becomes aligning specialized hardware efficiency with universally used tools, as RandomX attempts with CPUs.

The third alternative is early block finalization—implementing moving checkpoints to consider blocks below a certain depth as final. Vitalik Buterin describes this as "weak subjectivity"[^423].

Bitcoin ABC introduced such an algorithm on November 20, 2018, in Bitcoin Cash, to counter threats from Bitcoin SV, considering blocks final after 11 confirmations. This persists in some Bitcoin Cash and XEC implementations and is enforced by major exchanges, making it a de facto consensus rule.

Ethereum Classic, after multiple double-spend attacks in 2019 and 2020, integrated a variant called Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring (MESS) on October 11, 2020. MESS assigns different scores to competing branches, favoring earlier-seen segments. It purportedly reduces attack costs by a factor of 31.

While these algorithms reduce opportunistic attack risks by preventing reorganizations, they adversely affect censorship attacks aiming to destroy chain utility. They introduce subjectivity issues—a synchronizing node can be deceived by attackers presenting a longer chain, causing confusion[^424].

Ideally, Bitcoin includes no checkpoints beyond the predefined genesis block, with chain correctness determined solely by accumulated work. Despite implementing manual checkpoints himself, Satoshi Nakamoto stated:

"The software has no way of automatically knowing if one chain is better than another except by the total proof-of-work. In the design, it needed to go with the longest chain, no matter how far back it had to go"[^425].

## Proof of Stake {#la-preuve-denjeu .unnumbered}

An alternative to Nakamoto's proof-of-work is another Sybil attack resistance mechanism: proof of stake. Proof of stake allows participants to demonstrate involvement through staking units in the system, impacting validator selection for block production. The likelihood of validating a block is often proportional to the staked amount.

Staked units are locked and can be destroyed if validators act maliciously—a deterrent against the "nothing-at-stake problem," where validators might validate multiple competing chains. For example, Ethereum's Casper FFG implements "slashing" to penalize misbehaving validators[^426], protecting against short-range attacks. Checkpoints, separating "epochs," counter long-range attacks due to proof-of-stake's subjectivity.

The concept dates back to Wei Dai's 1998 b-money proposal (see Chapter [6](#ch:cybermonnaie){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:cybermonnaie"}), where servers deposited b-money to participate, serving as collateral.

The term "proof of stake" was coined in July 2011 by forum user QuantumMechanic, suggesting its adaptation for cryptocurrencies[^427]. Sunny King and Scott Nadal implemented it in August 2012 with PPCoin (now Peercoin), using a hybrid model combining energy and coin age.

Variations include delegated proof of stake (considering staked and delegated units) and other forms like proof of storage (Peercoin), proof of velocity (Reddcoin), and proof of importance (NEM).

Generally, Sybil resistance mechanisms in open systems can be external proofs (based on physical energy use) or internal proofs (based on ledger state). Proof of stake's self-referential nature can pose issues.

Proponents argue proof of stake is more secure due to higher attack costs. A censorship attack could also devalue the unit, reducing the attacker's capital. However, we argue proof of stake offers weaker censorship resistance.

Firstly, accumulating necessary units isn't insurmountable. Not all holders participate in consensus; attack thresholds often require only 34% of staked funds. Centralized entities offering staking services, subject to regulation and co-option, control large unit portions.

Secondly, proof of stake allows better validator identification, linked to public keys and staked funds, whereas miners in proof of work can discretely redirect hash power.

Lastly, and most critically, proof of stake's internal nature makes fighting censorship harder. Unlike proof of work, where additional energy can counteract censorship, proof of stake doesn't allow creating new units without altering consensus rules. Censors controlling majority units remain untouchable.

To address this, Ethereum's proof-of-stake advocates suggest relying on social consensus—not only manually selecting valid chains but rebalancing unit distributions to eliminate censorship. Creating new units raises allocation issues, so instead, censors' staked funds could be destroyed—a "social slashing"[^428]. Vitalik Buterin supports this, stating:

"For harder-to-detect attacks (like a 51% coalition censoring others), the community can coordinate a minority user-activated soft fork (UASF) where the attacker's funds are significantly destroyed (in Ethereum, via the 'inactivity leak' mechanism). No explicit 'hard fork to delete coins' is needed; except for coordinating the UASF to select a minority block, everything else is automated and follows protocol rules"[^429].

As of writing, this measure hasn't been applied in Ethereum. The closest case was the dispute between Justin Sun's Tron Foundation and the Steem community, leading to the community freezing the foundation's funds in March 2020—a split between Steem and Hive resulted.

While social consensus might seem appealing, it's risky, potentially causing confusion and splits. Ultimately, this distinction reflects differing threat models between proof of stake and proof of work. Bitcoin's security model is more stringent than Ethereum's due to these considerations.

## Energy Consumption and Resistance to Censorship {#consommation-dénergie-et-résistance-à-la-censure .unnumbered}

Proof of work is crucial for Bitcoin's resistance to censorship. Nakamoto's genius lies in devising a consensus mechanism based on an external, objective quantity—allowing censorship resolution without human protocol intervention, even against state attacks.

Implementing proof of work consumes significant electrical energy, anchoring the protocol in reality—a necessary price for true censorship resistance. Consumption can be reduced but not eliminated.

Energy consumption is a common critique against Bitcoin due to perceived environmental impact[^430]. However, as discussed, opposing Bitcoin's energy use might exacerbate conflicts between financial control and censorship resistance, increasing energy consumption on both sides. Promoting greater monetary and banking competition to reduce Bitcoin's utility could more effectively reduce energy use.

Proposals to abandon proof of work, like Greenpeace's in 2022, fall into the category of social attacks on Bitcoin. Fortunately, Bitcoin also has defense mechanisms at this level. In the following chapters, we'll explore how the protocol can be modified and the underlying principles guiding its evolution.
