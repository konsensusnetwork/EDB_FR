# Preface by Jacques Favier {#préface-de-jacques-favier .unnumbered}

Ludovic Lars is widely regarded as one of the foremost French-speaking "scholars" on Bitcoin. This term, which surfaced in several conversations about his publishing project, inspired the theme of this preface.

When he honored me by requesting this preface, he cautioned that the "liberal" tone of his *Elegance of Bitcoin* might contrast with my own sensibilities. Yet, I perceived in it a kind of moral *elegance*. Indeed, the author has read both the so-called "Austrian" economists and Proudhon, and he is no more a stubborn or toxic maximalist than I am. As someone who opposes ideological extremisms and one-dimensional reasoning, I cannot be offended that within a community advocating for decentralized solutions, differing opinions prevail, along with their inherent visions and biases.

Embracing what one might once have called a true "Benedictine labor," the author sought and gained the trust of numerous specialists who ensured that his work incorporated a broad spectrum of knowledge and received meticulous review. Beyond this collaboration of experts, there was a genuine communal, financial, and moral commitment to bring this book to publication.

Thus, we encounter here a work that, through its seldom polemical tone, profound erudition, and integration into a collective movement, participates in the tradition of the French *Encyclopedia*. It is known that the promoters of the *Britannica* accused Diderot and d'Alembert's encyclopedia of "spreading anarchy," and it cannot be denied that, composed during the blossoming of the Enlightenment, this compendium of all kinds of knowledge—both theoretical and practical—courageously took sides in the political and philosophical struggles of its time, explicitly intending to foster critical reflection and "change the common way of thinking." Perhaps the same can be said here: Bitcoin and this book invite you not merely, or not only, to change currency but to change thought.

Perceiving this connection, I delved into the *Encyclopedia*. The article on "Erudition," penned by d'Alembert himself, states that it "encompasses three principal branches: the knowledge of History, of Languages, and of Books." By perhaps substituting *languages* with *protocols*, he might also have appreciated—and prefaced better than I—the book you are about to open.

My own mind, shaped by historical studies, reveled in the initial chapters, which form veritable Annals of Bitcoin. Historians of today and the future will surely value the extensive reliable information and compiled references. As a mathematician by training, the author first produced a substantial archival work, evidenced by nearly a thousand scholarly footnotes.

As the creator of Bitcoin.fr wrote to me, "He uncovers and deciphers obscure debates that nonetheless played a crucial role in the evolution of the protocol, making them understandable to all." Therefore, while his presentation of monetary history might be critiqued or reframed in light of his personal convictions, his construction of Bitcoin's history is a contribution from which others will beneficially draw.

Beyond History, there are the Languages and the Books: references, code, game theory, and mathematics. There is much to harvest in these pages—many austere subjects, but also delightful anecdotes. While the book details the inevitable story of the famous pizza, it also reminds us that a Bitcoin faucet operated for two years, dispensing 5 bitcoins upon each request, or that the individual who discovered the first flaw graciously informed Satoshi instead of exploiting his discovery to cheat. It highlights that before its phase of "conflictual growth," the early years of the venture saw "organic and cautious growth, protected from the opportunism and propaganda of our world," and that the community has exhibited, from the very beginning, extraordinary resilience—something worthy of contemplation.

The wealth of quotations does justice to the cypherpunks, sometimes depicted as sinister figures fomenting a tax revolt over an ill-timed barbecue. It restores the historical and intellectual depth of what was a collective grassroots movement, not a superficial sectarian reaction. Furthermore, the meticulously retraced individual paths demonstrate that Austrian influence, though significant, was neither universal nor absolute. Many cryptographers, cypherpunks or otherwise, did not embrace it as a revealed dogma or a scientifically established truth.

Ludovic Lars also underscores this crucial point: the cypherpunks were not alone in trying to construct distributed systems capable of facilitating monetary exchange—because there was a genuine problem and a genuine need. Amid the intellectual ferment, exchanges were plentiful; it is amusing to recall that Ripple was also inspired by the localism of LETS schemes! In fact, what sets Bitcoin apart from all other attempts is that it—the first not to rely on trust in the classical sense—succeeded as a currency because it managed to build an elective, philosophical, and political community. Bitcoin is the largest community currency of all time.

Thus, delving into its long saga both before and after 2009 is not merely a historian's whim. Beyond gaining essential insight into its roots, the intentions, and ambitions that motivated its precursors and those who witnessed its birth, one finds ample material to debunk many persistent intellectual deceits. No, central bank digital currencies or algorithmic stablecoins do not represent refinements of Bitcoin, nor do they promise improvements to our future existence.

The various altcoins—somewhat community-driven, often entrepreneurial or even banking—are extensively cited, primarily to illustrate the discussion, enrich it with examples, and highlight dead ends or objections. Never, it bears repeating, and even though the author is well acquainted with them, is the aim to "surpass" or "perfect" Bitcoin, whose organic development and refinement is the concern of bitcoiners.

The author is a technical expert, yet he also knows how to write. All that is technical (and overlooked by many people, even those who present themselves as "experts")—everything that d'Alembert would term "the Languages"—is dissected in this work with an extremely meticulous scalpel and rendered in the language where what is well conceived "is stated clearly." This deserves to be given to the next politician, financier, economist, or commentator who claims that "it rests on nothing"!

The title of the book is also that of a pleasantly balanced conclusion between those who see Bitcoin as the panacea and those who view it solely negatively. It may surprise some fervent and naïve adherents, but it remains in the spirit of d'Alembert: "In criticism, there are two extremes to equally avoid, too much indulgence and too much severity."

Curiously, the author dwells little on the word *elegance* itself, which his mathematical background perhaps leads him to perceive as encompassing truth, beauty, and rigor. Like Aristotle, he may have contemplated order, precision, and the ability to harmonize multiple concepts, adjusting them effectively together—a feat that Satoshi Nakamoto achieved at the highest level.

To address the reader at the threshold of this useful, dense, and distinguished book, I once again give the floor to d'Alembert, who opined that "the assistance we have today for erudition facilitates it so much that our laziness would be inexcusable if we did not take advantage of it."
