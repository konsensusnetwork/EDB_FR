# Preface {#avant-propos .unnumbered}

Since its inception in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has sparked extensive discussion. Over the years, it has ignited intense passions and been the subject of numerous heated debates. Thousands of articles have been written, hundreds of videos produced, and dozens of books published on the topic. The surge in its price has granted it extraordinary media visibility, embedding it into the global collective imagination.

Yet, Bitcoin remains widely misunderstood. Many speak of it with only a superficial grasp, failing to discern its true utility. Some believe it serves merely for speculation; others imagine it is used exclusively by criminals; and some even assert that it is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme. Conversely, a number of individuals harbor unrealistic expectations, thinking it could become the world's reserve currency or even replace all monetary exchanges in the economy within a few years. Immersed in this delusion, they cling to the hope that its price will reach astronomical levels, continuing the speculative rises of the past. However, few attempt to adopt a realistic and sober perspective that balances the dreamers' vision—who see Bitcoin as the solution to all the world's problems—with the disingenuous detractors who consider Bitcoin a scourge to be halted at all costs.

I first learned about Bitcoin in April 2013, following the Cypriot financial crisis. Initially quite skeptical, I nonetheless took an interest in the system, as it was highlighted by the French liberals and American libertarians I followed. On July 9, 2015, I decided to give it a try: I acquired €50 worth of bitcoins (0.2 BTC) from the Swiss exchange platform Fastcoin (now known as Bity), which I received in my newly created Electrum wallet. That day, I made my first transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. These few fractions of bitcoin allowed me to make donations: first to the blogger H16, then to activist Adam Kokesh, followed by the DarkWallet project by Amir Taaki and Cody Wilson, and finally to the Sci-Hub platform managed by Alexandra Elbakyan.

My real involvement with Bitcoin began in the spring of 2017, when the price started to rise again after years of stagnation. Until then, I had merely followed the cryptocurrency from a distance, and this increase piqued my interest. It was at that moment that I fully immersed myself in this world. I read extensively on the subject, acquiring works such as *Bitcoin, la monnaie acéphale* by Adli Takkal-Bataille and Jacques Favier, *Mastering Bitcoin* by Andreas Antonopoulos, and *Digital Gold* by Nathaniel Popper. I also began speculating on a modest scale by purchasing bitcoin and various alternative cryptocurrencies.

Simultaneously, I started writing on the topic, eventually becoming a contributor for specialized sites like Cryptoast and Journal du Coin. Over the years, I have written more than 150 in-depth articles on various subjects related to cryptocurrency, whether from a technical, economic, or political perspective. My understanding of Bitcoin matured accordingly, to the point where I could claim to "understand Bitcoin," even if my conception remained, of course, partial and influenced by my own perspective.

However, this was not necessarily the case among those around me, who had only a superficial idea and likely lacked the time to delve deeper. This motivated me to write this book. In particular, since the monetary protocol depends on the economic actions of its users, it seemed important to share the genuine knowledge that emerged from my research and experience. Moreover, with the progression of banking censorship, the development of central bank digital currencies, the war on cash, and the return of inflation, I believe it is more essential than ever to fully grasp this tool to use it effectively in the future.

This work aims to present Bitcoin in a clear and comprehensive manner, adopting multiple viewpoints. It narrates the long journey that led to its creation, as well as its brief but dense history from its origins to the present day. It describes its essentially economic functioning stemming from its monetary nature. It addresses the political issues Bitcoin responds to, particularly the problem of censorship. Finally, it examines its technical mechanisms in detailed and precise terms. By reading this book, you may perhaps, like me, come to see Bitcoin as a harmonious whole, whose foundational model possesses a rare elegance.

I hope you will appreciate this modest contribution to something that transcends us all: the project of an alternative, free, and resilient currency, offering ordinary individuals the ability to resist the powers of this world. *Vires in numeris*.
